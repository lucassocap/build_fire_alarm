National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code
2019 Edition
This edition of NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code, was prepared by the Technical
Committees on Fundamentals of Fire Alarm and Signaling Systems, Testing and Maintenance of Fire
Alarm and Signaling Systems, Initiating Devices for Fire Alarm and Signaling Systems, Notification
Appliances for Fire Alarm and Signaling Systems, Protected Premises Fire Alarm and Signaling
Systems, Emergency Communication Systems, Supervising Station Fire Alarm and Signaling Systems,
Public Emergency Reporting Systems, and Single- and Multiple-Station Alarms and Household
Signaling Systems, released by the Correlating Committee on Signaling Systems for the Protection of
Life and Property, and acted on by NFPA at its June Association Technical Meeting held June 11–14,
2018, in Las Vegas, NV. It was issued by the Standards Council on August 14, 2018, with an effective
date of September 3, 2018, and supersedes all previous editions.
This document has been amended by one or more Tentative Interim Amendments (TIAs) and/or
Errata. See "Codes & Standards" at www.nfpa.org for more information.
This edition of NFPA 72 was approved as an American National Standard on September 3, 2018.
Origin and Development of NFPA 72
The development of NFPA's signaling standards dates back to 1898 with the appointment of the
Committee on Thermo-Electric Fire Alarms. The 1905 edition of NBFU 71A, Rules and Requirements of
the National Board of Fire Underwriters for the Construction, Installation, and Use of Signaling Systems Used for
the Transmission of Signals Affecting the Fire Hazard as Recommended by the National Fire Protection
Association, and related documents dating back to 1903 were among the first of numerous signaling
standards published in conjunction with the National Fire Protection Association. The descendants
of these earlier standards were consolidated into the National Fire Alarm Code, NFPA 72.
The first edition of the National Fire Alarm Code, published in 1993, was a consolidation of the 1989
edition of NFPA 71, Standard for the Installation, Maintenance, and Use of Signaling Systems for Central
Station Service; the 1990 edition of NFPA 72, Standard for the Installation, Maintenance, and Use of
Protective Signaling Systems; the 1990 edition of NFPA 72E, Standard on Automatic Fire Detectors; the 1989
edition of NFPA 72G, Guide for the Installation, Maintenance, and Use of Notification Appliances for
Protective Signaling Systems; the 1988 edition of NFPA 72H, Guide for Testing Procedures for Local, Auxiliary,
Remote Station, and Proprietary Protective Signaling Systems; and the 1989 edition of NFPA 74, Standard for
the Installation, Maintenance, and Use of Household Fire Warning Equipment. Many of the requirements of
these standards were identical or very similar. The recommendations that were taken from the guides
(NFPA 72G and NFPA 72H) were changed to mandatory requirements.
The 1996 edition of NFPA 72 incorporated many changes of a technical nature. These changes
related to the Americans with Disabilities Act, software testing, fire modeling, and communications.
The 1999 edition represented a major change in code content and organization. The chapters
were arranged to facilitate user friendliness and provide a logical structure. A new chapter on public
fire reporting was added, and many technical revisions were made. Annex B (formerly Appendix B)
was streamlined to facilitate ease of use, many unenforceable terms were removed, and Chapter 3
was reorganized to facilitate a more logical approach.
The 2002 edition reflected an extensive editorial revision of the Code to comply with the latest
edition of the Manual of Style for NFPA Technical Committee Documents. These revisions included the
addition of three administrative chapters at the beginning of the Code: Administration, Referenced
Publications, and Definitions. Eight technical chapters followed the administrative chapters in the
same sequence as in the 1999 edition. Other editorial revisions included the breakout of paragraphs
with multiple requirements into individually numbered paragraphs for each requirement, the
minimization of use of exceptions, the use of consistent headings for sections and section
subdivisions, and reorganization to limit paragraph numbering to six digits.

NATIONAL FIRE ALARM AND SIGNALING CODE72-2
2019 Edition
The 2002 edition contained a number of technical revisions throughout the Code, including the following:
(1) A major revision of the power supply requirements
(2) A new requirement addressing impairments to fire alarm systems
(3) Additional requirements concerning the review and approval of performance-based detection system designs
(4) Revision of the rules for system survivability from attack by fire
(5) The introduction of rules for an alternate approach for audible signaling
(6) The addition of requirements to address performance-based designs for visible signaling
(7) The relocation of testing and maintenance requirements for single- and multiple-station alarms and household fire
alarm systems to the testing and maintenance chapter
(8) Revisions to re-establish the prescriptive rules for household fire-warning equipment from the 1996 edition of the
Code
The 2007 edition contained several technical revisions including many to accommodate new technology and to take
advantage of new research. Changes were made to better address the integration of mass notification systems and other systems
with fire alarm systems. Revisions were also made in several areas of the Code for clarity and to enhance its usability.
Some of the more significant revisions in the 2007 edition addressed protection of fire alarm control units, personnel
qualifications, heat detector response time, smoke detector spacing, smoke detection in ducts, detectors that use multiple
sensing inputs, video image smoke and flame detection, synchronization of visible notification appliances, exit marking
audible notification appliances, tactile notification appliances, different types of protected premises fire alarm systems, and in-
building enhancement systems for fire fighter radio communications. The 2007 edition also included significant changes to
the requirements for smoke alarms in residential applications, revisions to require the interconnection of smoke alarms for
existing occupancies, revisions to require additional smoke alarms for larger dwelling units, and revisions to allow voice
messages to be included as a part of the smoke alarm notification signal.
Revisions in the 2007 edition to enhance and clarify the Code included those that address suppression system inputs to the
fire alarm system, emergency/voice alarm communications systems, fire alarm system interface with elevator systems, and the
means to indicate central station service. In addition, a complete revision of the Record of Completion Form along with
examples of filled-out forms were provided.
The 2007 edition also included the addition of two new annexes — one to provide guidance for the design of mass
notification systems and one to replace previous annex material for the design of fire service interfaces with a separate industry
standard.
The 2010 edition of the Code presented a major change in the scope and organization of the document. This was reflected
in the new title, National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code. The broader scope of the Code included emergency communications
systems in addition to the traditional scope of fire alarm systems. A new chapter on emergency communications systems (ECS)
was added to provide requirements for a variety of systems used for communication of information in various emergency
situations. The ECS chapter included new systems such as in-building mass notification systems, wide area mass notification
systems, distributed recipient mass notifications systems, two-way radio communications enhancement systems, and area of
refuge emergency communications systems. The ECS chapter also included two systems formerly in the chapter on protected
premises fire alarm systems: (in-building fire) emergency voice/alarm communications systems and two-way in-building wired
(telephone) emergency services communication systems.
Two other new chapters were added in the 2010 edition. The new chapter on circuits and pathways included requirements
and information formerly from the chapters on fundamentals of fire alarm systems and from the chapter on protected
premises fire alarm systems. This new chapter provided circuit and pathway performance (class) designations and pathway
survivability level designations as well as general wiring requirements presented in a format that allowed use by any type of
system covered in the Code. The new chapter on emergency control functions and interfaces included requirements and
information formerly contained in the chapter of protected premises fire alarm systems. In this chapter the term fire safety
function generally was replaced with the term emergency control function to reflect the potentially broader application beyond just
fire alarm systems. This new chapter also included new provisions for first-responder-use elevators and elevators for occupant-
controlled evacuation.
The 2010 edition was reorganized substantially to accommodate the new chapters in a logical order with reserved chapter
numbers included to minimize the potential for further renumbering in the future. The overall organization included
administrative chapters, support chapters, and system chapters as well as numerous annexes for usability.
Significant revisions were also made throughout the 2010 edition to reflect the broader application of the Code to
emergency communication systems. These included revisions in the chapter on fundamentals to address power supply
requirements, signal priorities, signal distinction and documentation requirements; revisions to the protected premises
chapter to better accommodate non–fire alarm systems in combination systems; revisions to the supervising station chapter and
public emergency reporting system chapter to allow their use for emergency communications systems; and revisions to the
testing and maintenance chapter to incorporate requirements for the inspection, testing, and maintenance of mass
notification systems and two-way radio communications enhancement systems.

ORIGIN & DEVELOPMENT 72-3
2019 Edition
In addition to the content of the new chapters, the 2010 edition included significant technical changes. These included new
requirements for signaling to the deaf and hard of hearing, new requirements and guidance for the design, installation, and
testing of voice communications systems to ensure voice intelligibility, and extensive revision of requirements for the
installation of smoke detectors in both level and sloped joist and beam ceiling applications.
Revisions to the supervising station chapter in the 2010 edition included the retirement of four legacy transmission
technologies no longer being installed: active multiplex transmission systems, McCulloh systems, directly connected noncoded
systems, and private microwave systems. The subsection on Other Transmission Technologies was relocated to become the
default subsection for supervising stations communications methods.
Modifications in the 2010 edition to the chapter on single- and multiple-station alarms and household fire alarms systems
included new provisions to address the interconnection of smoke alarms using wireless technology, new provisions for signaling
to those with hearing loss, and new requirements and guidance for the placement of smoke alarms and smoke detectors.
The 2010 edition included two new guidance annexes, Annex C on system performance and design and Annex D on
speech intelligibility.
The 2013 edition of the Code was built on the organizational changes made in the 2010 edition. A new Chapter 7,
Documentation, was added to improve the usability of the document and provided a central location for all the documentation
requirements of the Code. In some cases, the documentation provisions were contained directly in the new chapter. In other
cases, references were provided to the locations of documentation requirements contained in other chapters. As an example,
the new chapter contained the minimum documentation requirements that applied to any system covered by the Code, while
additional document requirements that might apply from other parts of the Code or from other governing laws, codes, or
standards were listed with an appropriate reference. The Record of Completion and Record of Inspection, Testing, and
Maintenance forms were included at the end of the chapter and were completely revised to be easier to use with a basic form
for straightforward systems and supplemental forms for more complex systems.
Chapter 10, Fundamentals, was reorganized for the 2013 edition to provide a more user-friendly flow of requirements. In
addition, requirements for circuit monitoring found in the previous edition of Chapter 10 were relocated to Chapter 12,
Circuits and Pathways, a more logical location.
Extensive usability changes also were made in the inspection and testing tables of Chapter 14, Inspection, Testing, and
Maintenance. The visual inspection table was updated, adding new inspection methods for each component along with the
inspection frequency. The test methods and test frequency tables were combined into a single table so that the test method
appeared along with the test frequency for each component. The component listings in both tables were reorganized and
coordinated so that components and equipment were easier to find.
The 2013 edition of the Code also included many technical updates. Among those updates were changes in Chapter 10
requiring supervising station operators and fire alarm system service providers to report to the authority having jurisdiction
certain conditions of system impairment. Requirements for inspection, testing, and service personnel qualifications were
updated to better reflect the level of qualification needed for each type of activity.
Changes were also made in Chapter 18, Notification Appliances, requiring documentation of the locations that require
audible notification appliances as well as documentation of the audibility levels that must be produced. Area of coverage
requirements were added for visible notification appliances. Changes were made in Chapter 21, Emergency Control Function
Interfaces, to address requirements for elevator recall when sprinklers are installed in elevator pits. The requirements for
occupant evacuation elevators were completely revised to coordinate with changes made in ASME A17.1/B44, Safety Code for
Elevators and Escalators. Changes were made in Chapter 24, Emergency Communications Systems, to address the use of
microphones and of textual and graphical visible notification appliances for primary or supplemental notification, and to
update the requirements for emergency command centers. Changes were made in Chapter 26, Supervising Station Alarm
Systems, to address alarm signal verification, alarm signal content, and restoration of signals. Those changes were made in part
to help emergency responders better manage issues related to unwanted alarms. In addition, new definitions for unwanted
alarms were added to more precisely identify the sources of those alarms. Changes were also made to update the
communications methods addressed in Chapter 26. Among them were changes to the supervision interval requirements for
communications paths and changes to the types of transmission means that can be used for the second channel of a digital
alarm communicator transmitter (DACT). Changes were made in Chapter 29, Single- and Multiple-Station Alarms and
Household Fire Alarm Systems, to address the connection of sprinkler waterflow switches to multiple-station alarms and to add
new requirements addressing the smoke alarm resistance to common nuisance sources.
The 2016 edition made many changes relative to documentation. Chapter 7 revised and added items to the minimum
documentation, documentation for new emergency communications systems, and software documentation requirements; and
addressed review of electronic documentation media formats. Requirements for documentation of qualifications for the system
designer and personnel who program systems were more clearly addressed while providing for the allowance for system design
trainees. New criteria were added for plans examiners and inspectors.

NATIONAL FIRE ALARM AND SIGNALING CODE72-4
2019 Edition
Perhaps the most significant changes to the Code pertained to wiring. The 2016 edition added Class N, which addressed
Ethernet infrastructures for alarm and signaling systems, and pathway performance and installation criteria were provided.
Class A and Class X pathway separation requirements were revised to address emergency control function interface devices
controlled by the fire alarm system on those circuits. Level 2 and Level 3 pathway survivability requirements were revised,
which provided flexibility of use and addressed other fire-resistive methods.
The 2016 edition of the Code added language relative to recalled equipment observed during inspection and testing and
clarified the intent of periodic visual inspections relative to building or other changes that could affect the performance of the
system. With the exception of reference and requirements pertaining to survivability, requirements for the design, installation,
testing, and maintenance of in-building emergency radio communications enhancement systems were relocated to NFPA 1221,
Standard for the Installation, Maintenance, and Use of Emergency Services Communications Systems.
Chapter 17 revised the requirements for total coverage and expanded its annex language to address general consideration
for elevator shafts and enclosed stairways. The requirements for placement of smoke detectors used for door release were also
revised to provide additional flexibility in locating detectors.
Chapter 24 was restructured, providing greater user friendliness while expanding the section on risk analysis. Emphasis was
placed on the importance of effective message development. Annex G, Guidelines for Emergency Communication Strategies
for Buildings and Campuses, based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Fire Protection Research
Foundation research, was added to the 2016 edition.
Language was changed in Chapter 26 to require that when multiple communication paths are used for performance-based
technologies or the two transmission means for a digital alarm communicator transmitter they be arranged to avoid a single
point of failure.
Chapter 29 added requirements pertaining to remote resetting and silencing of a fire alarm control unit from other than
the protected premises for a minimum of 4 minutes from the initial activation of the fire alarm signal. Smart phones and
Internet access to almost any device made remote access to residential equipment possible. The ability to establish remote
access to a fire alarm system was addressed. Also, a new requirement established that, where a communication or transmission
means other than DACT is used, all equipment necessary to transmit an alarm signal must be provided with a minimum of 24
hours of secondary power capacity.
The 2019 edition reflects a number of changes. The requirements for fire service access elevators and occupant evacuation
elevators (OEE) were completely revised to coordinate with changes made in ASME A17.1/CSA B44. The requirements for
occupant evacuation operation (OEO) are revised extensively. Annex text is added for clarification, as is Figure A.21.6,
Simplified Occupant Evacuation Operation (OEO) (elevator system interface with the building fire alarm system based on
ASME A17.1, Section 2.27.11; and NFPA 72, Section 21.6). In addition to the requirements for area of refuge (area of rescue
assistance), Chapter 24 is revised to include requirements for stairway communications systems, elevator landing
communications systems, and occupant evacuation elevator lobby communications systems. A review was accomplished and
revisions made to ensure alignment of NFPA 72 with the Manual of Style for NFPA Technical Committee Documents. These editorial
revisions include the breakout of paragraphs with multiple requirements into individually numbered paragraphs for each
requirement and the minimization of use of exceptions. For many years, when codes required visual (or visible) notification in
addition to audible notification, strobe lights meeting the requirements of Chapter 18 were used. With newer LED products
that can be used for fire alarm, the terms strobe, light, and visible are essentially changed to visual notification appliance. The terms
speaker and high power speaker array (HPSA) are changed to loudspeaker and high power loudspeaker array (HPLA) for consistency.
Perhaps the most significant change to the Code pertains to carbon monoxide. In August 2015, the Standards Council
voted to relocate material that is in NFPA 720, Standard for the Installation of Carbon Monoxide (CO) Detection and Warning
Equipment, to various chapters of NFPA 72. These requirements are essentially incorporated into Chapter 17 for carbon
monoxide detectors; Chapter 14 for installation, testing, and maintenance; Chapter 29 for carbon monoxide alarms; and new
Annex H. Chapter 29 is greatly expanded, and a significant amount of annex text has been added for explanation. NFPA 720 is
to be withdrawn as the requirements are moved to NFPA 72.
Chapter 14, Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance, is greatly modified to incorporate valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA)
batteries. The inspection and testing requirements are revised in Tables 14.3.1 and 14.4.3.2. This also expands the annex
language to address use and testing of these batteries. Several new terms are introduced, and these are defined in Chapter 3.

connections with no observable corrosion.
(16) Transceivers X Annually Verify proper operation and mounting is not compromised.
aSome transmission equipment (such as, but not limited to, cable modems, fiber-optic interface nodes, and VoIP interfaces) are typically powered by
the building's electrical system using a secondary (standby) power supply that does not meet the requirements of this Code. This is intended to
ensure that the testing authority verifies full secondary (standby) power as required by Chapter 10. Additionally, refer to Table 14.4.3.2, items 7
through 9, for secondary (standby) power supply testing.
bThe automatic transmission of the check-in (handshake) signal can take up to 60 minutes to occur.
cSee Table 14.4.3.2, Item 4(1) for the testing of transmission equipment.
dThe battery tests in Table 14.4.3.2 Item 9 are based on VRLA batteries and it is the intent that the tests specified in (1) through (4) be performed in
order. For other secondary battery types, refer to the battery manufacturer’s published instructions or IEEE 450, Recommended Practice for Maintenance,
Testing, and Replacement of Vented Lead-Acid Batteries for Stationary Applications, for vented lead-acid batteries, and IEEE 1106, Recommended Practice for
Installation, Maintenance, Testing, and Replacement of Vented Nickel-Cadmium Batteries for Stationary Applications, for nickel-cadmium batteries.
eExample: 4000 mAh × 1∕25 = 160 mA charging current at 77°F (25°C).
fIf the charger is adjustable, adjust the output voltage to 2.265 volts per cell ±0.015 volts at 77°F (25°C) or as specified by the alarm equipment
manufacturer.
gSee A.14.4.3.2 Item 9(4). A load test per Item 9(5) is permitted in lieu of an ohmic test.
hSee A.14.4.3.2 Item 9(5).
iThe voltmeter sensitivity has been changed from 1000 ohms per volt to 100 ohms per volt so that the false ground readings (caused by induced
voltages) are minimized.
jInitiating devices such as smoke detectors used for elevator recall, closing dampers, or releasing doors held in the open position that are permitted by
the Code (see9.6.3 of NFPA 101) to initiate supervisory signals at the fire alarm control unit (FACU) should be tested at the same frequency (annual) as
those devices when they are generating an alarm signal. They are not supervisory devices, but they initiate a supervisory signal at the FACU.
kFusible thermal link detectors are commonly used to close fire doors and fire dampers electrically connected to the fire alarm control unit. They are
actuated by the presence of external heat, which causes a solder element in the link to fuse, or by an electric thermal device, which, when energized,
generates heat within the body of the link, causing the link to fuse and separate.
lNote, it is customary for the manufacturer of the smoke detector to test a particular product from an aerosol provider to determine acceptability for
use in smoke entry testing of their smoke detector/smoke alarm. Magnets are not acceptable for smoke entry tests.
m There are some detectors that use magnets as a manufacturer's calibrated sensitivity test instrument.
nFor example, it might not be possible to individually test the heat sensor in a thermally enhanced smoke detector.
oManufacturer's published instructions should be consulted to ensure a proper operational test. No suppression gas or agent is expected to be
discharged during the test of the solenoid. See Test Plan of 14.2.10.
pA monitor module installed on an interface device is not considered a supervisory device and therefore not subject to the quarterly testing frequency
requirement. Test frequencies for interface devices should be in accordance with the applicable standard. For example, fire pump controller alarms
such as phase reversal are required to be tested annually. If a monitor module is installed to identify phase reversal on the fire alarm control unit, it is
not necessary to test for phase reversal four times a year.
qChapter 18 would require 15 dB over average ambient sound for public mode spaces. Sometimes the ambient sound levels are different from what
the design was based upon. Private operating mode would require 10 dB over average ambient at the location of the device.
rWhere building, system, or occupancy changes have been observed, the owner should be notified of the changes. New devices might need to be
installed and tested per the initial acceptance testing criteria.
sSee A.14.4.3.2 and Table 14.4.3.2, Item 24.

view (as defined in 3.3.106) of at least one detector.
17.8.3.3.4*   The location and spacing of the detectors shall be
adjusted using the inverse square law, modified for the atmos‐
pheric absorption and the absorption of nonburning fuel
suspended in the air in accordance with the manufacturer’s
published instructions.
17.8.3.3.5*   In applications where the sparks to be detected
could occur in an area not on the optical axis of the detector,
the distance shall be reduced or detectors shall be added to
compensate for the angular displacement of the fire in accord‐
ance with the manufacturer’s published instructions.

Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material. 2019 Edition
(7)* Information on the actions to be taken in case of an
alarm
(8) Minimum and recommended distances from fuel-
burning appliances
Annex A   Explanatory Material
Annex A is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document but is
included for informational purposes only. This annex contains explan‐
atory material, numbered to correspond with the applicable text para‐
graphs.
A.1.2   Fire alarm systems intended for life safety should be
designed, installed, and maintained to provide indication and
warning of abnormal fire conditions. The system should alert
building occupants and summon appropriate aid in adequate
time to allow for occupants to travel to a safe place and for
rescue operations to occur. The fire alarm system should be
part of a life safety plan that also includes a combination of
prevention, protection, egress, and other features particular to
that occupancy.
A.1.2.4   The intent of this paragraph is to make it clear that
the protection requirements are derived from the applicable
building or fire code, not from NFPA 72.
A.1.6.5   Where dimensions are expressed in inches, it is inten‐
ded that the precision of the measurement be 1 in., thus plus
or minus 1∕2 in. The conversion and presentation of dimensions
in millimeters would then have a precision of 25 mm, thus plus
or minus 13 mm.
A.3.2.1 Approved.    The National Fire Protection Association
does not approve, inspect, or certify any installations, proce‐
dures, equipment, or materials; nor does it approve or evaluate
testing laboratories. In determining the acceptability of installa‐
tions, procedures, equipment, or materials, the authority
having jurisdiction may base acceptance on compliance with
NFPA or other appropriate standards. In the absence of such
standards, said authority may require evidence of proper instal‐
lation, procedure, or use. The authority having jurisdiction
may also refer to the listings or labeling practices of an organi‐
zation that is concerned with product evaluations and is thus in
a position to determine compliance with appropriate standards
for the current production of listed items.
A.3.2.2 Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ).    The phrase
“authority having jurisdiction,” or its acronym AHJ, is used in
NFPA documents in a broad manner, since jurisdictions and
approval agencies vary, as do their responsibilities. Where
public safety is primary, the authority having jurisdiction may
be a federal, state, local, or other regional department or indi‐
vidual such as a fire chief; fire marshal; chief of a fire preven‐
tion bureau, labor department, or health department; building
official; electrical inspector; or others having statutory author‐
ity. For insurance purposes, an insurance inspection depart‐
ment, rating bureau, or other insurance company
representative may be the authority having jurisdiction. In
many circumstances, the property owner or his or her designa‐
ted agent assumes the role of the authority having jurisdiction;
at government installations, the commanding officer or depart‐
mental official may be the authority having jurisdiction.
A.3.2.3 Code.    The decision to designate a standard as a
“code” is based on such factors as the size and scope of the
document, its intended use and form of adoption, and whether
it contains substantial enforcement and administrative provi‐
sions.
A.3.2.5 Listed.    The means for identifying listed equipment
may vary for each organization concerned with product evalua‐
tion; some organizations do not recognize equipment as listed
unless it is also labeled. The authority having jurisdiction
should utilize the system employed by the listing organization
to identify a listed product.
Δ A.3.3.6 Acoustically Distinguishable Space (ADS).    All parts of
a building or area intended to have occupant notification are
subdivided into ADSs as defined. Some ADSs might be designa‐
ted to have voice communications capability and require that
those communications be intelligible. Other spaces might not
require voice intelligibility or might not be capable of reliable
voice intelligibility. An ADS might have acoustical design
features that are conducive for voice intelligibility, or it might
be a space where voice intelligibility could be difficult or impos‐
sible to achieve. Each is still referred to as an ADS.
In smaller areas, such as those under 400 ft 2 (40 m 2), walls
alone will define the ADS. In larger areas, other factors might
have to be considered. In spaces that might be subdivided by
temporary or movable partitions, such as ballrooms and meet‐
ing rooms, each individual configuration should be considered
a separate ADS. Physical characteristics, such as a change in
ceiling height of more than 20 percent, or a change in acousti‐
cal finish, such as carpet in one area and tile in another, would
require those areas to be treated as separate ADSs. In larger
areas, there might be noise sources that require a section to be
treated as a separate ADS. Any significant change in ambient
noise level or frequency might necessitate an area be consid‐
ered a separate ADS.
In areas of 85 dBA or greater ambient sound pressure level,
meeting the pass/fail criteria for intelligibility might not be
possible, and other means of communications might be neces‐
sary. So, for example, the space immediately surrounding a
printing press or other high-noise machine might be designa‐
ted as a separate ADS, and the design might call for some form
of effective notification but not necessarily require the ability to
have intelligible voice communications. The aisles or operator’s
control stations might be separate ADSs where intelligible voice
communication might be desired.
Significant differences in furnishings — for example, an area
with tables, desks, or low dividers adjacent to an area with high
shelving — would require separate consideration. The entire
desk area could be a single acoustic zone, whereas each area
between shelving could be a unique zone. Essentially, any note‐
worthy change in the acoustical environment within an area
will mandate consideration of that portion of the area to be
treated as an acoustic zone. Hallways and stairwells will typically
be considered as individual acoustic zones.
Spaces confined by walls with carpeting and acoustical ceil‐
ings can be deemed to be one ADS. An ADS should be an area
of consistent size and material. A change of materials from
carpet to hard tile, the existence of sound sources, such as
decorative waterfalls, large expanses of glass, and changes in
ceiling height, are all factors that might separate one ADS from
another.
Each ADS might require different components and design
features to achieve intelligible voice communication. For exam‐
ple, two ADSs with similar acoustical treatments and noise

levels might have different ceiling heights. The ADS with the
lower ceiling height might require more ceiling-mounted loud‐
speakers to ensure that all listeners are in a direct sound field
(see Figure A.3.3.6) . Other ADSs might benefit from the use of
alternate loudspeaker technologies, such as line arrays, to
achieve intelligibility.
An ADS that differs from another because of the frequency
and level of ambient noise might require the use of loudspeak‐
ers and system components that have a wider frequency band‐
width than conventional emergency communications
equipment. However, designers should not use higher band‐
width loudspeakers in all locations, unless needed to overcome
certain acoustic and ambient conditions. This is because the
higher bandwidth appliance will require more energy to
perform properly. This increases amplifier and wire size and
power supply requirements.
In some spaces, it might be impractical to achieve intelligibil‐
ity, and, in such a case, alternatives to voice evacuation might
be required within such areas.
There might be some areas of a facility where there are
several spaces of the same approximate size and the same
acoustic properties. For example, there might be an office
space with multiple individual offices, each with one loud‐
speaker. If one or two are satisfactorily tested, there is no need
to test all of them for speech intelligibility.
N A.3.3.12.3 Manual Fire Alarm Box.    The term box is currently
the term used by building codes and nationally recognized test‐
ing laboratories. They are also called manual fire alarm
stations, pull stations, and call points. (SIG-IDS)
N A.3.3.20 Ancillary Functions.    Ancillary functions can include
general paging, background music, or other non-emergency
signals. (SIG-ECS)
A.3.3.30 Average Ambient Sound Level.    The term average
ambient sound level  is also called the equivalent A-weighted
sound level measured over t hours, where t is the time period
over which the measurement is made. The standard industry
symbol is LA.eq.t. Where a measurement is taken over a 24-hour
time period, the designation would be LA.eq.24.
N A.3.3.31 Battery.    Common usage permits this designation to
be applied to a single cell used independently. Cells can be
connected in series or parallel, or both, to provide the required
operating voltage and current levels. (SIG-TMS)
A.3.3.38.3 Sloping Peaked-Type Ceiling.    Refer to Figure
A.17.6.3.4(a) for an illustration of smoke or heat detector spac‐
ing on peaked-type sloped ceilings.
A.3.3.38.4 Sloping Shed-Type Ceiling.    Refer to Figure
A.17.6.3.4(b) for an illustration of smoke or heat detector spac‐
ing on shed-type sloped ceilings.
A.3.3.40.3 Smooth Ceiling.    Open truss constructions are not
considered to impede the flow of fire products unless the
upper member, in continuous contact with the ceiling, projects
below the ceiling more than 4 in. (100 mm).
N A.3.3.41.4 Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid (VRLA) Cell.    VRLA
cells provide a means for recombination of internally gener‐
ated oxygen and the suppression of hydrogen gas evolution to
limit water consumption. (SIG-TMS)
A.3.3.47.2 Radio Channel.   The width of the channel depends
on the type of transmissions and the tolerance for the
frequency of emission. Channels normally are allocated for
radio transmission in a specified type for service by a specified
transmitter.
A.3.3.51 Coded.    Notification signal examples are numbered
strokes of an impact-type appliance and numbered flashes of a
visual appliance.
A.3.3.57 Communications Center.   Examples of functions of a
communications center are as follows:
(1) Communications between the public and the communi‐
cations center
(2) Communications between the communications centers,
the emergency response agency (ERA), and emergency
response facilities (ERFs)
(3) Communications within the ERA and between different
ERAs [1221:A.3.3.19]
(4) Communications with the public emergency alarm
reporting system
The central operating part of the public emergency alarm
reporting system is usually located at the communications
center.
A.3.3.61 Condition.    See Figure A.3.3.61 that describes the
Condition — Signal — Response model used in this Code.
There are varying degrees of conditions that require varying
degrees of response that are initiated by various types of
signals. A condition could be present without being detected
(either because detection of the condition was not required or
was not feasible), in which case, there is no signal or response.
A condition could be detected, resulting in a signal, but there

could be no required response. A signal could be generated
erroneously in the absence of a condition (due to malfunction
or other causes) resulting in an unwarranted response. The
condition is normal when no abnormal conditions are present.
A.3.3.61.1.1 Alarm Condition.    When an alarm condition is
present, damage to life or property has begun or will begin.
Detection, signaling, and response, effected quickly, can limit
or prevent damage. The extent of damage is often reduced
with inverse proportion to the time required for detection,
signaling, and response. The amount of time available for
detection, signaling, and response is generally not a known
quantity and damage might not be preventable. Alarm condi‐
tions can result due to the presence of fire, chemicals, freezing
temperatures, or other circumstances.
A.3.3.61.1.2 Pre-Alarm Condition.    Some examples of pre-
alarm conditions include the following: the presence of a very
small amount of visible smoke (at levels below listed initiating
device alarm thresholds), the presence of a smoke-like odor, a
somewhat elevated temperature, and a gradually increasing
temperature. Any abnormal condition that typically precedes
an alarm condition can be termed a pre-alarm condition.
The amount of time available for investigating the cause of a
pre-alarm condition is not a known quantity. If conditions dete‐
riorate to the point of alarm, time is no longer available for
investigation. Pre-alarm conditions might or might not
progress to alarm conditions.
The detection of pre-alarm conditions may be desirable in
some occupancies, particularly if environmental conditions are
ordinarily well controlled (e.g., integrated circuit fabrication
facility) and personnel are trained to respond appropriately. In
other occupancies, the detection of pre-alarm conditions may
not be desirable or necessary.

FIGURE A.3.3.61  Condition-Signal-Response Model.
The term pre-alarm condition is different from the terms posi‐
tive alarm sequence, alarm verification, and pre-signal.
A.3.3.61.1.3 Supervisory Condition.    A supervisory condition
occurs when one system supervises another system, process, or
equipment for failure or impairment, and a functional failure
or impairment to operation of the supervised system, process
or equipment has occurred. A supervisory condition might be a
regularly occurring and expected event such as a valve closed
on a sprinkler system. A closed valve is an abnormal condition
for the sprinkler system, but it does not constitute a trouble
condition in the fire alarm or signaling system.
In some cases, a fault in one system, causing a trouble condi‐
tion in that system, results in a supervisory condition in
another system because the other system is supervising some
function of the faulted system, and the supervised function has
been impaired. In those cases, both supervisory and trouble
conditions exist at the same time.
Some examples of supervisory conditions can include the
following:
(1) An event causing the activation of a supervisory initiating
device used to monitor an environmental parameter,
system element, component, or function, whose failure
poses a risk to life, property, or mission (e.g., sprinkler
valve closed, water tank low water level, low building
temperature, ECS impairment, and so forth).
(2) The failure of a guard to remain within established
constraints while on tour, usually indicated by the
absence of a guard's tour supervisory signal within
prescribed timing requirements, or the presence of a
guard's tour supervisory signal outside of prescribed
sequencing requirements, or the presence of a delin‐
quency signal.
(3) Public safety radio communications enhancement system
antenna malfunction, signal booster failure, or battery
depletion.
(4) In some cases, the presence of smoke in an HVAC duct or
in other places as defined by the authority having jurisdic‐
tion.
A.3.3.61.1.4 Trouble Condition.   A trouble condition is a fault
in the fire alarm or signaling system. The system or some aspect
of it is somehow broken. This is different from a supervisory
condition that is an abnormal condition in a system that is
supervised by the fire alarm or signaling system. Abnormal
conditions, such as a closed valve in a sprinkler system, not
caused by a fault are not considered trouble conditions.
In some cases, a fault in one system, causing a trouble condi‐
tion in that system, results in a supervisory condition because
another system is supervising some function of the faulted
system, and the supervised function has been impaired by the
fault (see A.3.3.61.1.3, Supervisory Condition) . In those cases,
both supervisory and trouble conditions exist at the same time.
A.3.3.63.1 Autonomous Control Unit (ACU).    Although an
ACU might incorporate provisions for messages or signals from
external sources, the ACU is fully capable of building controls
without the need for sources outside the building. An ACU is
allowed to be located within a primary building and supply
circuits to immediately adjacent support buildings such as
detached storage buildings. Larger buildings will generally
have their own ACUs to allow individual control within each
building.

N A.3.3.69 Design Professional.   An architect/engineer working
for the owner in the preparation of bid documents, overseeing
systems covered by this standard as part of a design-build
project, or an engineer performing a risk analysis, would be
considered a design professional under the requirements of
this standard. (SIG-ECS)
A.3.3.70.4 Combination Detector.    These detectors do not
utilize a mathematical evaluation principle of signal processing
more than a simple “or” function. Normally, these detectors
provide a single response resulting from either sensing
method, each of which operates independent of the other.
These detectors can provide a separate and distinct response
resulting from either sensing method, each of which is
processed independent of the other.
A.3.3.70.7 Fixed-Temperature Detector.    The difference
between the operating temperature of a fixed-temperature
device and the surrounding air temperature is proportional to
the rate at which the temperature is rising. The rate is
commonly referred to as thermal lag . The air temperature is
always higher than the operating temperature of the device.
Typical examples of fixed-temperature sensing elements are
as follows:
(1) Bimetallic. A sensing element comprised of two metals that
have different coefficients of thermal expansion arranged
so that the effect is deflection in one direction when
heated and in the opposite direction when cooled.
(2) Electrical Conductivity.  A line-type or spot-type sensing
element in which resistance varies as a function of
temperature.
(3) Fusible Alloy. A sensing element of a special composition
metal (eutectic) that melts rapidly at the rated tempera‐
ture.
(4) Heat-Sensitive Cable.  A line-type device in which the sens‐
ing element comprises, in one type, two current-carrying
wires separated by heat-sensitive insulation that softens at
the rated temperature, thus allowing the wires to make
electrical contact. In another type, a single wire is
centered in a metallic tube, and the intervening space is
filled with a substance that becomes conductive at a criti‐
cal temperature, thus establishing electrical contact
between the tube and the wire.
(5) Liquid Expansion.  A sensing element comprising a liquid
that is capable of marked expansion in volume in
response to an increase in temperature.
A.3.3.70.8 Flame Detector.   Flame detectors are categorized as
ultraviolet, single wavelength infrared, ultraviolet infrared, or
multiple wavelength infrared.
A.3.3.70.12 Multi-Criteria Detector.    A multi-criteria detector
is a detector that contains multiple sensing methods that
respond to fire signature phenomena and utilizes mathemati‐
cal evaluation principles to determine the collective status of
the device and generates a single output. Typical examples of
multi-criteria detectors are a combination of a heat detector
with a smoke detector, or a combination rate-of-rise and fixed-
temperature heat detector that evaluates both signals using an
algorithm to generate an output such as pre-alarm or alarm.
The evaluation can be performed either at the detector or at
the control unit. Other examples are detectors that include
sensor combinations that respond in a predictable manner to
any combination of heat, smoke, carbon monoxide, or carbon
dioxide.
A.3.3.70.13 Multi-Sensor Detector.   Typical examples of multi-
sensor detectors are a combination of a heat detector with a
smoke detector, or a combination rate-of-rise and fixed-
temperature heat detector that evaluates both signals using an
algorithm to generate an output such as pre-alarm or alarm.
The evaluation can be performed either at the detector or at
the control unit. Other examples are detectors that include
sensor combinations that respond in a predictable manner to
any combination of heat, smoke, carbon monoxide, or carbon
dioxide.
A.3.3.70.18 Rate Compensation Detector.    A typical example
of a rate compensation detector is a spot-type detector with a
tubular casing of a metal that tends to expand lengthwise as it
is heated and an associated contact mechanism that closes at a
certain point in the elongation. A second metallic element
inside the tube exerts an opposing force on the contacts, tend‐
ing to hold them open. The forces are balanced in such a way
that, on a slow rate-of-temperature rise, there is more time for
heat to penetrate to the inner element, which inhibits contact
closure until the total device has been heated to its rated
temperature level. However, on a fast rate-of-temperature rise,
there is not as much time for heat to penetrate to the inner
element, which exerts less of an inhibiting effect so that contact
closure is achieved when the total device has been heated to a
lower temperature. This, in effect, compensates for thermal
lag.
A.3.3.70.19 Rate-of-Rise Detector.    Typical examples of rate-of-
rise detectors are as follows:
(1) Pneumatic Rate-of-Rise Tubing. A line-type detector compris‐
ing small-diameter tubing, usually copper, that is installed
on the ceiling or high on the walls throughout the protec‐
ted area. The tubing is terminated in a detector unit that
contains diaphragms and associated contacts set to
actuate at a predetermined pressure. The system is sealed
except for calibrated vents that compensate for normal
changes in temperature.
(2) Spot-Type Pneumatic Rate-of-Rise Detector. A device consisting
of an air chamber, a diaphragm, contacts, and a compen‐
sating vent in a single enclosure. The principle of opera‐
tion is the same as that described for pneumatic rate-of-
rise tubing.
(3) Electrical Conductivity–Type Rate-of-Rise Detector.  A line-type
or spot-type sensing element in which resistance changes
due to a change in temperature. The rate of change of
resistance is monitored by associated control equipment,
and an alarm is initiated when the rate of temperature
increase exceeds a preset value.
A.3.3.71 Device (Class N).    Class N devices include compo‐
nents connected to a Class N network that monitor the envi‐
ronment (e.g., smoke, heat, contact closure, manual “in case of
fire” pull) and/or provide some output(s) (e.g., dry contact,
audible/visual alert/notification, addressable loudspeaker)
that are required to provide the real-time functionality neces‐
sary for the protection of life and property. In this way, a
component connected to the network used for noncritical
functions (i.e., maintenance) can be differentiated and exclu‐
ded from the monitoring for integrity requirements of Class N.
Also in this way, transport equipment (e.g., switches, routers,
hubs, media converters) and other equipment (e.g., printers,
storage devices) can be differentiated from the requirements
applied to Class N devices if they do not provide life safety–
specific environmental monitoring, inputs, or outputs for the

life safety system. This is not to say that this equipment is not
important to the overall operation of the system, just that this
equipment is not considered a “device” in the context of
Class N. Equipment that does not meet the definition of a
device cannot be specifically supervised but rather generally
supervised as they are part of the supervised pathways that serv‐
ice the Class N devices themselves.
A.3.3.81 Double Doorway.   Refer to Figure 17.7.5.6.5.3(A) for
an illustration of detector location requirements for double
doors.
A.3.3.87 Ember.    Class A and Class D combustibles burn as
embers under conditions where the flame typically associated
with fire does not necessarily exist. This glowing combustion
yields radiant emissions in parts of the radiant energy spectrum
that are radically different from those parts affected by flaming
combustion. Specialized detectors that are specifically designed
to detect those emissions should be used in applications where
this type of combustion is expected. In general, flame detectors
are not intended for the detection of embers.
A.3.3.92 Emergency Communications System — Emergency
Command Center.   An emergency command center can also
include the mass notification system control.
A.3.3.93 Emergency Control Function Interface Device.    The
emergency control function interface device is a listed relay or
other listed appliance that is part of the fire alarm system. An
example of an emergency control function interface device is
the fire alarm control relay that removes power to a fan control
unit.
A.3.3.94 Emergency Control Functions.    Emergency control
functions are meant to be observed functions, not equipment
or devices. Examples of emergency control functions are fan
control (operation or shutdown), smoke damper operation,
elevator recall, elevator power shutdown, door holder release,
shutter release, door unlocking, activation of exit marking devi‐
ces, and so forth. Fans, elevators, smoke dampers, door hold‐
ers, shutters, locked doors, or exit marking devices themselves
are not emergency control functions.
N A.3.3.95 Emergency Response Agency (ERA).    An ERA
includes any public, governmental, private, industrial, or mili‐
tary organization that engages in the operations specified in
the definition. [1221:A.3.3.44]
A.3.3.96 Emergency Response Facility (ERF).    Examples of
ERFs include a fire station, a police station, an ambulance
station, a rescue station, a ranger station, and similar facilities.
[1221:A.3.3.45]
A.3.3.98 Endpoint (Class N).    An endpoint device originates
and/or terminates a communication stream and does not
forward it to other devices.
An FACU, ACU, ECCU endpoint originates and/or termi‐
nates a communication stream with autonomy. If data is sent to
or received from other locations, that communications stream
forms a new path. The new path could even employ a different
communications protocol and, where permitted, have a differ‐
ent pathway class designation as defined in Section 12.3.
The exception in 12.3.6(1) shows Class N communication
paths do not require redundant paths when connected to a
single endpoint device. However, a connection to an FACU,
ACU, or ECCU must be redundant even when those elements
are an endpoint on a Class N communication path, with the
excepted allowance of 20 ft ( 6.1 m) inside a raceway or enclo‐
sure defined in 12.6.9.
N A.3.3.99 Energy Storage Systems.    Electrochemical energy
storage systems include uninterruptable power supplies (UPS).
A.3.3.100 Evacuation.    Evacuation does not include the reloca‐
tion of occupants within a building.
A.3.3.108 Fire Alarm Control Unit (FACU).   In addition to the
functions identified in the definition, a fire alarm control unit
might have an integral operator interface, supply power to
detection devices, notification appliances, transponder(s), or
off-premises transmitter(s) or any combination of these. The
control unit might also provide transfer of condition to relay or
devices connected to the control unit. There can be multiple
fire alarm control units in a fire alarm system.
A.3.3.108.2.1 Dedicated Function Fire Alarm Control Unit.    A
dedicated function fire alarm control unit could serve more
than one emergency control function, for example a dedicated
function fire alarm control unit could serve as a single control
unit for sprinkler system monitoring and elevator recall. In that
case, the control unit should be labeled as follows:
Sprinkler Waterflow AND Elevator Recall Control and Supervi‐
sory Control Unit
A.3.3.111.1 Combination System.    Examples of non-fire
systems are security, card access control, closed circuit televi‐
sion, sound reinforcement, background music, paging, sound
masking, building automation, time, and attendance.
A.3.3.111.4 Protected Premises (Local) Fire Alarm System.    A
protected premises fire alarm system is any fire alarm system
located at the protected premises. It can include any of the
functions identified in Section 23.3. Where signals are transmit‐
ted to a communications center or supervising station, the
protected premises fire alarm system also falls under the defini‐
tion of one of the following systems: central station service
alarm system, remote supervising station alarm system, propri‐
etary supervising station alarm system, or auxiliary alarm
system. The requirements that pertain to these systems apply in
addition to the requirements for the protected premises fire
alarm systems.
A.3.3.112 Fire Command Center.    The fire command center
should contain the following features as applicable to the
specific facility:
(1) Emergency voice/alarm communications system unit
(2) Fire department communications unit
(3) Fire detection and alarm system annunciator unit
(4) Annunciator unit visually indicating the location of the
elevators and whether they are operational
(5) Status indicators and controls for air-handling systems
(6) The required fire-fighter’s control panel for smoke
control systems installed in the building
(7) Controls for unlocking stairway doors simultaneously
(8) Sprinkler valve and waterflow detector display panels
(9) Emergency and standby power status indicators
(10) Telephone for fire department use with controlled
access to the public telephone system
(11) Fire pump status indicators
(12) Schematic building plans indicating the typical floor
plan and detailing the building core, means of egress,
fire protection systems, fire-fighting equipment, and fire
department access

A.3.3.128 Hearing Loss.   The severity of hearing loss is meas‐
ured by the degree of loudness, as measured in decibels, a
sound must attain before being detected by an individual.
Hearing loss can be ranked as mild, moderate, severe, or
profound. It is quite common for someone to have more than
one degree of hearing loss (e.g., mild sloping to severe). The
following list shows the rankings and their corresponding deci‐
bel ranges:
(1) Mild:
(a) For adults: between 25 and 40 dB
(b) For children: between 15 and 40 dB
(2) Moderate: between 41 and 55 dB
(3) Moderately severe: between 56 and 70 dB
(4) Severe: between 71 and 90 dB
(5) Profound: 90 dB or greater
NIOSH defines material hearing impairment as an average
of the hearing threshold levels for both ears that exceeds 25 dB
at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz.
The American Medical Association indicates that a person
has suffered material impairment when testing reveals a 25 dB
average hearing loss from audiometric zero at 500, 1000, 2000,
and 3000 Hz. OSHA has recognized that this is the lowest level
of hearing loss that constitutes any material hearing impair‐
ment.
A.3.3.136 Identified (as applied to equipment).    Some exam‐
ples of ways to determine suitability of equipment for a specific
purpose, environment, or application include investigations by
a qualified testing laboratory (listing and labeling), an inspec‐
tion agency, or other organizations concerned with product
evaluation. [70:100, Informational Note]
N A.3.3.137 Immediately (as used in Chapter 26).    Actions that
are performed “immediately” should be performed within a
maximum of 90 seconds from receipt of a signal.
A.3.3.138 Impairment.    An impairment is a system component
or function that is not working properly, which can result in the
system or unit not functioning when required. This might be
due to an intentional act, such as closing a valve or disabling an
initiating device. The impairment also might be caused by a
deficiency in a piece of equipment or subsystem. An example
of emergency impairment is physical damage to a control unit
or wiring. Examples of a planned impairment include the addi‐
tion of new devices or appliances or the reprogramming of
system software.
Δ A.3.3.139 In  Writing.   The definition of in writing  should be
applied to any documentation mandated by this Code whereby
a statement or notification, or both, is required to be provided
by the sender to a separate and distinct entity or to multiple
entities, such as between an inspection, testing, and mainte‐
nance service provider and a building owner or between a
supervising/central station provider and the authority having
jurisdiction.
Such correspondence should be authorized and recognized
by the sender as an official representation of their organization
and clearly identifiable from the recipient's perspective as
having been authorized by the sender. Examples of corre‐
spondence made in writing could include, but not be limited to,
hard copy or digital notification that includes company letter‐
head or other type of company designation, authorized signa‐
tory or signatories either in digital form or on hard copy, or in
an email signature block, or any combination thereof. Exam‐
ples where such correspondence would be required could
include, but not be limited to, test plans, inspection and testing
reports, notification of deficiencies/corrections, change of
supervising/central station providers, notification of recalled
equipment, or suspected low audibility levels for alarm signal‐
ing.
The definition of in writing  should not be applied to text
messages, voice mails, notations on scratch paper, or any simi‐
lar means of notification that fail to reflect the verifiable and
authenticated nature of correspondence that is submitted in
writing, as that term is defined by this Code.
A.3.3.145 Intelligible.    The term intelligible is intended to
address only the communications channel and the acoustic
environment as shown in Figure A.3.3.145. Intelligibility
assumes that the talker or recorded voice message is in a
language and using words known to the listener. It also assumes
that the listener has normal hearing.

A.3.3.146.1.1 Emergency Control Function Interface.    See
Figure A.3.3.146.1.1.
A.3.3.146.2 Fire Alarm Control Interface.   Some mass notifica‐
tion systems' autonomous control units (ACUs) might not be
listed to UL 864 for fire alarm service. Any component that is
connected to the fire alarm system must be connected through
a listed interface that will protect the functions of other systems
should one system experience a failure. This can be through
isolation modules, control relays, or other approved means that
are listed for the intended use. As an example, failure of a
stand-alone ACU should not affect any function of the FACU.
A.3.3.155 Local Operating Console (LOC).    An LOC allows
users within a building to activate prerecorded messages,
deliver live voice messages, observe current status of the main
autonomous control unit (ACU), or have similar such ACU
operator functions at various locations within the building. An
LOC serves a similar function as a remote fire alarm annuncia‐
tor. However, there can be multiple LOC locations within a
building, such as on each floor, at each main entry point, at the
switchboard or receptionist's console, or as determined by a
risk analysis.

Managed facilities-based voice network service is functionally
equivalent to traditional PSTN-based services provided by
authorized common carriers (public utility telephone compa‐
nies) with respect to dialing, dial plan, call completion,
carriage of signals and protocols, and loop voltage treatment
and provides all of the following features:
(1) A loop start telephone circuit service interface.
(2) Pathway reliability that is assured by proactive manage‐
ment, operation, and maintenance by the MFVN
provider.
(3) 8 hours of standby power supply capacity for MFVN
communications equipment either located at the protec‐
ted premises or field deployed. Industry standards
followed by the authorized common carriers (public util‐
ity telephone companies), and the other communications
service providers that operate MFVNs, specifically engi‐
neer the selection of the size of the batteries, or other
permanently located standby power source, in order to
provide 8 hours of standby power with a reasonable
degree of accuracy. Of course, over time, abnormal ambi‐
ent conditions and battery aging can always have a poten‐
tially adverse effect on battery capacity. The MFVN field-
deployed equipment typically monitors the condition of
the standby battery and signals potential battery failure to
permit the communications service provider to take
appropriate action.
(4) 24 hours of standby power supply capacity for MFVN
communications equipment located at the communica‐
tions service provider’s central office.
(5) Installation of network equipment at the protected prem‐
ises with safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to the
equipment and its connections.
When providing telephone service to a new customer, MFVN
providers give notice to the telephone service subscriber of the
need to have any connected alarm system tested by authorized
fire alarm service personnel in accordance with Chapter 14 to
make certain that all signal transmission features have
remained operational. These features include the proper func‐
tioning of line seizure and the successful transmission of signals
to the supervising station. In this way, the MFVN providers
assist their new customers in complying with a testing proce‐
dure similar to that outlined in 26.2.7 for changes to providers
of supervising station service.
The evolution of the deployment of telephone service has
moved beyond the sole use of metallic conductors connecting a
telephone subscriber’s premises with the nearest telephone
service provider’s control and routing point (wire center). In
the last 25 years, telephone service providers have introduced a
variety of technologies to transport multiple, simultaneous tele‐
phone calls over shared communication pathways. In order to
facilitate the further development of the modernization of the
telephone network, the authorized common carriers (public
utility telephone companies) have transitioned their equip‐
ment into a managed facilities-based voice network (MFVN)
capable of providing a variety of communications services in
addition to the provision of traditional telephone service.
Similarly, the evolution of digital communications technol‐
ogy has permitted entities other than the authorized common
carriers (public utility telephone companies) to deploy robust
communications networks and offer a variety of communica‐
tions services, including telephone service.
These alternate service providers fall into two broad catego‐
ries. The first category includes those entities that have emula‐
ted the MFVN provided by the authorized common carriers.
The second category includes those entities that offer tele‐
phone service using means that do not offer the rigorous qual‐
ity assurance, operational stability, and consistent features
provided by an MFVN.

NATIONAL FIRE ALARM AND SIGNALING CODE72-194
2019 Edition Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material.
The Code intends to only recognize the use of the telephone
network transmission of alarm, supervisory, trouble, and other
emergency signals by means of MFVNs.
For example, the Code intends to permit an MFVN to
provide facilities-based telephone (voice) service that interfaces
with the premises fire alarm or emergency signal control unit
through a digital alarm communicator transmitter (DACT)
using a loop start telephone circuit and signaling protocols
fully compatible with and equivalent to those used in public
switched telephone networks. The loop start telephone circuit
and associated signaling can be provided through traditional
copper wire telephone service (POTS — “plain old telephone
service”) or by means of equipment that emulates the loop start
telephone circuit and associated signaling and then transmits
the signals over a pathway using packet switched (IP) networks
or other communications methods that are part of an MFVN.
Providers of MFVNs have disaster recovery plans to address
both individual customer outages and widespread events such
as tornados, ice storms, or other natural disasters, which
include specific network power restoration procedures equiva‐
lent to those of traditional landline telephone services.
A.3.3.163 Manufacturer’s Published Instructions.    Manufac‐
turer’s applicable documentation can be subject to revision.
A.3.3.164 Mass Notification Priority Mode.    Nonemergency
mass notification activations are not intended to initiate this
mode of operation.
A.3.3.165 Mass Notification System.    A mass notification
system can use intelligible voice communications, visual signals,
text, graphics, tactile, or other communications methods. The
system can be used to initiate evacuation or relocation or to
provide information to occupants. The system can be intended
for fire emergencies, weather emergencies, terrorist events,
biological, chemical or nuclear emergencies, or any combina‐
tion of these. The system can be automatic, manual, or both.
Access to and control of the system can be from a single, on-site
location or can include multiple command locations, including
some remote from the area served. Systems can be wired, wire‐
less, or some combination of the two.
A.3.3.180 Nonrequired.    There are situations where the appli‐
cable building or fire code does not require the installation of
a fire alarm system or specific fire alarm system components,
but the building owner wants to install a fire alarm system or
component to meet site-specific needs or objectives. A building
owner always has the option of installing protection that is
above the minimum requirements of the Code. It is the intent
of the Code that any fire alarm system, or fire alarm system
components installed voluntarily by a building owner, meet the
requirements of the applicable portions of the Code. However,
it is not the intent of the Code that the installation of a nonre‐
quired fire alarm system, or fire alarm system components, trig‐
ger requirements for the installation of additional fire alarm
system components or features. For example, the installation of
a fire alarm control unit and fire detectors to service a specific
area, such as a computer room or flammable liquid storage
room, does not trigger a requirement for audible or visual noti‐
fication appliances, manual fire alarm boxes, or other fire
alarm system features in other parts of the building.
A.3.3.182.1.2 Textual Audible Notification Appliance.    An
example of a textual audible notification appliance is a an elec‐
trical acoustic transducer that reproduces a voice or tone
signal, such as a loudspeaker.
A.3.3.182.3.1 Textual Visual Notification Appliance.    Textual
visual notification appliances provide temporary text, perma‐
nent text, or symbols and include, but are not limited to,
annunciators, monitors, CRTs, displays, and printers.
A.3.3.186 Occupiable.    The term occupiable is used in this
Code and in other governing laws, codes, or standards to deter‐
mine areas that require certain features of a system. It is impor‐
tant for designers to understand that unless otherwise
required, spaces that are not occupiable might not require or
need coverage by initiating devices or occupant notification
appliances. For example, most closets would not be considered
to be occupiable. However, a space of the same size used as a
file room would be considered occupiable.
A.3.3.188 Octave Band.    Frequencies are generally reported
based on a standard, preferred center frequency, fc. The band‐
width of a particular octave band has a lower frequency, fn, and
an upper frequency, fn+1. The relationships are as follows:
f fn n
k
+ =1 2/
where:
k = 1 for octave bands
k = 1/3 for one-third octave bands
and
f fc n= 21 2/
For example, the 500 Hz octave band (center frequency) has
a lower limit of 354 and an upper limit of 707 Hz. The octave
band with a center frequency of 1000 Hz has a lower frequency
of 707 Hz and an upper frequency of 1414 Hz.
A.3.3.195 Ownership.    Inspection, testing, and maintenance is
the responsibility of the property or building owner, or it can
be transferred by contract. Systems installed, owned, or leased
by a tenant are the responsibility of the tenant. The installing
company should provide written notice of these responsibilities
to the system user.
A.3.3.221.1 Auxiliary Alarm System.    Alarms from an auxiliary
alarm system are received at the communications center on the
same equipment and by the same methods as alarms transmit‐
ted from public alarm boxes.
A.3.3.228 Qualified.   Qualified might also mean that the
person has knowledge of the installation, construction, or oper‐
ation of apparatus and the hazards involved.
A.3.3.235 Radio Frequency.   The present practicable limits of
radio frequency (RF) are roughly 10 kHz to 100,000 MHz.
Within this frequency range, electromagnetic waves can be
detected and amplified as an electric current at the wave
frequency. Radio frequency  usually refers to the RF of the
assigned channel. [1221:A.3.3.86]

A.3.3.250 Response.    Responses can be effected manually or
automatically. One response to a signal might be to activate
notification appliances or transmitters, which in turn generate
additional signals. See A.3.3.61.
A.3.3.250.1 Alarm Response.    Examples include activation of
alarm notification appliances, elevator recall, smoke control
measures, emergency responder dispatch, and deployment of
resources in accordance with a risk analysis and the associated
emergency response plan.
A.3.3.250.2 Pre-Alarm Response.    Examples include the acti‐
vation of appropriate notification appliances, dispatch of
personnel, investigation of circumstances and problem resolu‐
tion in accordance with a risk analysis and action plan, prepara‐
tion for a potential alarm response, and so forth.
A.3.3.250.3 Supervisory Response.    Examples include the acti‐
vation of supervisory notification appliances, the shutdown of
machines, fan shutdown or activation, dispatch of personnel,
investigation of circumstances and problem resolution in
accordance with a risk analysis and action plan, and so forth.
A.3.3.250.4 Trouble Response.    Examples include the activa‐
tion of trouble notification appliances, dispatch of service
personnel, deployment of resources in accordance with an
action plan, and so forth.
N A.3.3.258 Separate Sleeping Area.    Bedrooms (or sleeping
rooms) separated by other use areas, such as kitchens or living
rooms (but not bathrooms), are considered separate sleeping
areas.
A.3.3.261 Shop Drawings.    Shop drawings typically include the
property location, scaled floor plans, equipment wiring details,
typical equipment installation details, riser details, conduit/
conductor size, and routing information needed to install a fire
alarm and/or signaling system.
A.3.3.263 Signal.    See A.3.3.61.
A.3.3.263.1 Alarm Signal.    Examples of alarm signals include
outputs of activated alarm initiating devices, the light and
sound from activated alarm notification appliances, alarm data
transmission to a supervising station, and so forth.
A.3.3.263.5 Fire Alarm Signal.    Examples include outputs
from activated fire alarm initiating devices (manual fire alarm
box, automatic fire detector, waterflow switch, etc.), the light
and sound from activated fire alarm notification appliances,
fire alarm data transmission to a supervising station, and so
forth.
A.3.3.263.6 Guard’s Tour Supervisory Signal.    The term
guard's tour supervisory signal, associated with systems supporting
guard's tour supervisory service, is a message indicating that a
guard has actuated a guard's tour reporting station (not in
itself an indication of a supervisory condition). Guard's tour
supervisory signals are not a subset of the general category of
supervisory signals as used in this Code.
A.3.3.263.7 Pre-Alarm Signal.    Examples include outputs of
analog initiating devices prior to reaching alarm levels, the
light and sound from activated pre-alarm notification applian‐
ces, aspiration system outputs indicating smoke at levels below
the listed alarm threshold, and so forth.
A.3.3.263.9 Supervisory Signal.    Examples include activated
supervisory signal-initiating device outputs, supervisory data
transmissions to supervising stations, the light and sound from
activated supervisory notification appliances, a delinquency
signal indicating a guard's tour supervisory condition, and so
forth.
The term guard's tour supervisory signal , associated with
systems supporting guard's tour supervisory service, is a
message indicating that a guard has activated a guard's tour
reporting station (not in itself an indication of a supervisory
condition). Guard's tour supervisory signals are not a subset of
the general category of supervisory signals as used in this Code.
A.3.3.263.10 Trouble Signal.    Examples include off-normal
outputs from integrity monitoring circuits, the light and sound
from activated trouble notification appliances, trouble data
transmission to a supervising station, and so forth.
A.3.3.276.2 Ionization Smoke Detection.    Ionization smoke
detection is more responsive to invisible particles (smaller than
1 micron in size) produced by most flaming fires. It is some‐
what less responsive to the larger particles typical of most smol‐
dering fires. Smoke detectors that use the ionization principle
are usually of the spot type.
A.3.3.276.3 Photoelectric Light Obscuration Smoke Detection.
The response of photoelectric light obscuration smoke detec‐
tors is usually not affected by the color of smoke.
Smoke detectors that use the light obscuration principle are
usually of the line type. These detectors are commonly referred
to as projected beam smoke detectors.
A.3.3.276.4 Photoelectric Light-Scattering Smoke Detection.
Photoelectric light-scattering smoke detection is more respon‐
sive to the visible particles (larger than 1 micron in size)
produced by most smoldering fires. It is somewhat less respon‐
sive to the smaller particles typical of most flaming fires. It is
also less responsive to black smoke than to lighter colored
smoke. Smoke detectors that use the light-scattering principle
are usually of the spot type.
A.3.3.276.5 Video Image Smoke Detection (VISD).    Video
image smoke detection (VISD) is a software-based method of
smoke detection that has become practical with the advent of
digital video systems. Listing agencies have begun testing VISD
components for several manufacturers. VISD systems can
analyze images for changes in features such as brightness,
contrast, edge content, loss of detail, and motion. The detec‐
tion equipment can consist of cameras producing digital or
analog (converted to digital) video signals and processing
unit(s) that maintain the software and interfaces to the fire
alarm control unit.
A.3.3.282 Spark.    The overwhelming majority of applications
involving the detection of Class A and Class D combustibles
with radiant energy–sensing detectors involve the transport of
particulate solid materials through pneumatic conveyor ducts
or mechanical conveyors. It is common in the industries that
include such hazards to refer to a moving piece of burning
material as a spark and to systems for the detection of such fires
as spark detection systems.
A.3.3.314 Unwanted Alarm.    Unwanted alarms are any alarms
that occur when there is no hazard condition present. These
are sometimes also called false alarms. Because the term false
has been used by many people to mean many different things,
this Code is instead using the terms unwanted, fault, nuisance,
unintentional, unknown, and malicious to categorize the different

types of alarms. Unwanted alarms might be intentional, unin‐
tentional, or unknown. If they were caused intentionally, they
might have been done by someone with the intent to cause
disruption and should be classified as malicious. However, an
unintentional alarm might occur when, for example, a child
actuated a manual fire alarm box not knowing the consequen‐
ces. Similarly, someone accidentally causing mechanical
damage to an initiating device that results in an alarm is caus‐
ing an unintentional alarm.
A.3.3.314.2 Nuisance Alarm.    Nuisance alarms are unwanted
alarms. Sometimes nuisance alarms might be called false
alarms. In this Code, any unwanted alarm is considered false
because they are not indicative of real hazards. Because the
term false has been used by many people to mean many differ‐
ent things, this Code is instead using the terms unwanted,
nuisance, and malicious to categorize the different types of
alarms. They occur when some condition simulates a fire or
other hazardous condition. For example, cigarette smoke can
activate smoke detectors and smoke alarms. In that case, there
might not be anything wrong with the smoke detector or
smoke alarm — it is doing its job responding to the condition
or stimulus that it was designed to detect. Another example
would be a heat detector or heat alarm that activates when
someone inadvertently points a hair dryer towards it. A mali‐
cious alarm occurs when someone intentionally activates the
detector or alarm when there is no fire hazard. See the defini‐
tions of malicious, unintentional, unknown, and unwanted
alarms.
A.3.3.316 Video Image Flame Detection (VIFD).    Video image
flame detection (VIFD) is a software-based method of flame
detection that can be implemented by a range of video image
analysis techniques. VIFD systems can analyze images for
changes in features such as brightness, contrast, edge content,
loss of detail, and motion. The detection equipment can
consist of cameras producing digital or analog (converted to
digital) video signals and processing unit(s) that maintain the
software and interfaces to the fire alarm control unit.
A.3.3.321 Wavelength.    The concept of wavelength is
extremely important in selecting the proper detector for a
particular application. There is a precise interrelation between
the wavelength of light being emitted from a flame and the
combustion chemistry producing the flame. Specific subato‐
mic, atomic, and molecular events yield radiant energy of
specific wavelengths. For example, ultraviolet photons are emit‐
ted as the result of the complete loss of electrons or very large
changes in electron energy levels. During combustion, mole‐
cules are violently torn apart by the chemical reactivity of
oxygen, and electrons are released in the process, recombining
at drastically lower energy levels, thus giving rise to ultraviolet
radiation. Visible radiation is generally the result of smaller
changes in electron energy levels within the molecules of fuel,
flame intermediates, and products of combustion. Infrared
radiation comes from the vibration of molecules or parts of
molecules when they are in the superheated state associated
with combustion. Each chemical compound exhibits a group of
wavelengths at which it is resonant. These wavelengths consti‐
tute the chemical’s infrared spectrum, which is usually unique
to that chemical.
This interrelationship between wavelength and combustion
chemistry affects the relative performance of various types of
detectors with respect to various fires.
N A.3.3.325 Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) (as used in Chap‐
ter 26).   Each node participates in routing by forwarding data
for other nodes. The data hops from node to node until it
reaches the receiving point. Which nodes forward data can be
predetermined or determination can be made dynamically on
the basis of network connectivity. Wireless mesh networks are
often designed to self-form and self-heal. Wireless mesh
networks can be implemented with various wireless technolo‐
gies. (SIG-SSS)
A.3.3.328.2 Signaling Zone.    A notification zone is the smallest
discrete area used for any announcements or signaling.
Depending on the emergency response plan, a signaling zone
can encompass several notification zones. For example, in most
high-rise buildings, each single floor (fire area) is a notification
zone. Most emergency response plans call for the signaling
zone to be the fire floor, floor above, and a floor below.
For example, the floors of a high rise that are playing the
evacuation message and the “wait in place” message would be
in the same notification zone, because they are activated simul‐
taneously. The word “identical” clarifies that the notification
zone is communicating a common message.
A.7.1.3   Unless otherwise identified, only the minimum docu‐
mentation requirements of 7.2.1 apply. More stringent docu‐
mentation requirements found in other chapters and other
laws, codes, and standards, as well as project specifications,
should identify any other documentation sections in this chap‐
ter that would be applicable.
A.7.2   It is not intended that all of the details outlined in
Sections 7.3 through 7.5 be required for every project. In
general, the more complex the system, the more stringent the
requirements become for documentation. It is recognized that
some projects would require only the minimum documenta‐
tion listed in Section 7.2. Other projects might require more
detailed documentation. Sections 7.3 through 7.5 provide
menus of additional means of documenting a system. The
intent is for other governing laws, codes, or standards; other
parts of this Code; or project specifications or drawings to
select the additional specific pieces of documentation from
Sections 7.3 through 7.5.
A.7.2.1   In many cases, the installer might not have adequate
record drawings or other completion documentation for the
existing system. As an example, where a temporary school
building is being installed, the fire alarm system subpanel in
the temporary building should be fully documented, but the
fire alarm system for the entire existing school might be so old
that adequate documentation might not exist. In this example,
documentation required in Section 7.2 should be completed
only for the new subpanel and the interfaces to the existing
school fire alarm system.
A.7.2.1(1)   The purpose for a written narrative is to provide a
description of the work to be performed and could be as
simple as “Install additional three smoke detectors to provide
coverage for newly installed meeting room.” However, it could
be desirable to include why or by whose direction the work is
being done, such as “at owner’s request,” “per specifications
dated …,” or “at the direction of … .” See also Section 23.3 for
additional system feature documentation requirements.

N A.7.2.1(12)   Paragraph 26.6.2.4 allows for the following three
communications pathway options when a supervising station
fire alarm system is provided:
(1) Performance-based technologies
(2) Digital alarm communicator systems
(3) Radio systems, which includes one-way private and two-
way RF systems
Chapter 26 includes several requirements specific to each of
these communications pathway alternatives. In order to verify
the provided communication path(s), and any shared equip‐
ment, comply with Code requirements, the following are exam‐
ples of information that should be submitted as the minimum
documentation for a supervising station fire alarm system:
(1) Performance-based technologies
(a) The type of performance-based transmitter(s) to be
used such as IP communicators, cellular radios, and
so forth
(b) Whether communications with the supervising
station will be via a single pathway or a multiple
pathway
(c) An indication of the use, where applicable, of
shared equipment such as routers, modems, and
LANs within the protected premises
(d) Battery calculations for the shared equipment,
which should meet the requirements of 26.6.3.13
(2) Digital alarm communicator system
(a) The primary communications pathway, which
should be a telephone line
(b) The secondary communications pathway, which
should comply with 26.6.4.1.4
(3) Radio system
(a) The type of radio system that will be used (private
one-way or two-way RF)
(b) The secondary power provided for the radio trans‐
mitter
Where the transmitter equipment is located separately from
the main fire alarm control unit, an indication of its protection
in accordance with 10.4.4 should also be provided within the
minimum documentation.
A.7.3.1   See Section 7.2 for the minimum documentation
requirements.
A.7.3.2   Design (layout) documents should contain informa‐
tion related to the system that could include specifications,
shop drawings, input/output matrix, battery calculations, noti‐
fication appliance voltage drop calculations for visual notifica‐
tion appliances and loudspeakers, and product technical data
sheets.
Design (layout) documents could include such items as
preliminary plans issued as guidance and direction, risk analy‐
sis, emergency response plan, or a combination of these.
Deviations from requirements of governing laws, codes,
standards, or preliminary plan requirements specified by an
engineer should be clearly identified and documented as such.
Documentation of equivalency, where applicable, should be
provided in accordance with Section 1.5 and be included with
the record drawings.
It is the intent that existing systems that are altered should
have design (layout) documents prepared that are applicable
only to the portion(s) of the system being altered.
Δ A.7.3.3   Preliminary plans such as those used for bidding, solic‐
itation, or for obtaining permits could contain information as
follows:
Performance criteria required in support of alternative
means and methods for other codes, standards, or construction
features should be clearly identified on the design (layout)
documentation.
Such information should reference applicable waivers,
appeals, variances, or similarly approved deviations from
prescriptive criteria.
Preliminary documents could include the following:
(1) Specifications and narrative applicable to the project
(2) Interface requirements between systems such as fire
alarm, mass notification, security, HVAC, smoke control,
paging, background music, audio visual equipment,
elevators, access control, other fire protection systems,
and so forth
(3) Sequence of operation
(4) Survivability of system circuits and equipment, when
applicable
(5) Notification zones, when applicable
(6) Message content for voice systems
(7) Means of system monitoring that is to be provided, when
applicable
(8) Codes and editions applicable to the system(s)
(9) Special requirements of the owner, governing authority,
or insurance carrier, when applicable
(10) Voice delivery components beyond standard industry
products required to achieve intelligibility
When devices are located (spaced) on preliminary drawings,
the devices should be located (spaced) in accordance with
standards, listings, and limitations of the equipment specified.
When devices are not located (spaced) on the preliminary
documents, a note should be included directing that the spac‐
ing should be per listing(s) and this Code.
When known, acoustic properties of spaces should be indica‐
ted on the preliminary design (layout) documents.
The architect/engineer preparing bid documents should
not simply require a contractor to install a fire alarm system in
accordance with codes, but rather outline the intended mini‐
mum performance criteria to be achieved in accordance with
Section 7.3, with guidance from A.7.3.3.
A.7.3.4.1   See Section 7.2 for the minimum documentation
requirements.
A.7.3.6   The Risk Analysis Checklist in Figure A.7.3.6 is not
mandatory, but it can be used to initiate the thought process
for identifying hazards in a facility.

NATIONAL FIRE ALARM AND SIGNALING CODE72-200
2019 Edition Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material.
A.7.3.7   When a system or component is installed in accord‐
ance with performance-based design criteria, such systems
should be reviewed and acceptance tested by a design profes‐
sional to verify that performance objectives are attained.
Due to unique design and construction challenges, fire
protection concepts are often established on performance-
based engineering practices. When such practices have been
approved by the authority having jurisdiction, the engineer of
record should sign off on the final installation documents to
ensure that all conditions have been satisfied. Such engineer‐
ing analysis could be beyond the qualifications of the code
authority. As such, it is imperative that the engineer of record
review and accept final concepts as accepted by the authority
having jurisdiction.
A.7.3.9.1   Evaluation documentation can also include docu‐
mentation such as that associated with performance-based
alternatives and documentation related to equivalencies as well
as any other special documentation that is specific to a particu‐
lar system. Examples of where evaluations might be required
are found in 23.4.3.1 and 24.5.24.2.
A.7.4.1   See Section 7.2 for the minimum documentation
requirements.
A.7.4.2   It is important to note that shop drawings and particu‐
larly the word “sheets” do not necessarily mean physical paper
sheets, but could be on electronic media.
A.7.4.9   For an example of an input/output matrix of opera‐
tion, see A.14.6.2.4.
A.7.5.1   See Section 7.2 for the minimum documentation
requirements.
Δ A.7.5.3(1)   An owner’s manual should contain the following
documentation:
(1) A detailed narrative description of the system inputs,
evacuation signaling, ancillary functions, annunciation,
intended sequence of operations, expansion capability,
application considerations, and limitations.
(2) A written sequence of operation in matrix or narrative
form.
(3) Operator instructions for basic system operations, includ‐
ing alarm acknowledgment, system reset, interpretation
of system output (LEDs, CRT display, and printout), oper‐
ation of manual evacuation signaling and ancillary func‐
tion controls, and change of printer paper.
(4) A detailed description of routine maintenance and test‐
ing as required and recommended and as would be provi‐
ded under a maintenance contract, including testing and
maintenance instructions for each type of device instal‐
led. This information should include the following:
(a) Listing of the individual system components that
require periodic testing and maintenance
(b) Step-by-step instructions detailing the requisite test‐
ing and maintenance procedures, and the intervals
at which these procedures are to be performed, for
each type of device installed
(c) A schedule that correlates the testing and mainte‐
nance procedures
(5) A service directory, including a list of names and tele‐
phone numbers of those who provide service for the
system.
A.7.5.5.2   For an example of an input/output matrix of opera‐
tion, see A.14.6.2.4.
A.7.5.5.5   It is important that the documentation required by
this section is available for technicians so they will be able to
recognize variations of system configuration during accept‐
ance, reacceptance, and periodic testing. It is also necessary for
enforcement personnel in order to prevent confusion when
they could otherwise misidentify an approved variation for
being non-code compliant. This documentation is also neces‐
sary for those who might design additions or modifications.
A.7.5.6.1   It is the intent of this section to permit using forms
other than Figure 7.8.2(a) through Figure 7.8.2(f) as long as
they convey the same information.
A.7.5.6.2   Protected premises fire alarm systems are often
installed under construction or remodeling contracts and
subsequently connected to a supervising station alarm system
under a separate contract. All contractors should complete the
portions of the record of completion documentation for the
portions of the connected systems for which they are responsi‐
ble. Several partially completed documents might be accepted
by the authority having jurisdiction provided that all portions
of the connected systems are covered in the set of documents.
Δ A.7.5.6.3   The requirements of Chapter 14 should be used to
perform the installation wiring and operational acceptance
tests required when completing the record of completion.
The record of completion form shall be permitted to be
used to record decisions reached prior to installation regarding
intended system type(s), circuit designations, device types, noti‐
fication appliance type, power sources, and the means of trans‐
mission to the supervising station.
A.7.5.6.6.3   It is the intent that if an original or current record
of completion is not available for the overall system, the instal‐
ler would provide a new record of completion that addresses
items discovered about the system. The installer will complete
the respective sections related to the overall system that have
been discovered under the current scope of work. It is not the
intent of this section to require an in-depth evaluation of an
existing system solely for the purpose of completing a system-
wide record of completion.
A.7.5.8   This section is intended to provide a basis for the
authority having jurisdiction to require third-party verification
and certification that the authority having jurisdiction and the
system owner can rely on to reasonably assure that the fire
alarm system installation complies with the applicable require‐
ments. Where the installation is an extension, modification, or
reconfiguration of an existing system, the intent is that the veri‐
fication be applicable only to the new work and that reaccep‐
tance testing be acceptable.
A.7.7.1.2   It is intended that archived records be allowed to be
stored in electronic format as long as hard copies can be made
from them when required.
Δ A.7.7.2.3   The intent is that paper and/or electronic docu‐
ments should not be stored inside the control unit because
control units are not typically approved for the storage of
combustible material.
Examples of system documents include the following:
(1) Record drawings (as-builts)
(2) Equipment technical data sheets

Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material. 2019 Edition
(3) Alternative means and methods, variances, appeals,
approvals, and so forth
(4) Performance-based design documentation in accordance
with 7.3.7
(5) Risk analysis documentation in accordance with 7.3.6
(6) Emergency response plan in accordance with 7.3.8
(7) Evaluation documentation in accordance with 7.3.9
(8) Software and firmware control documentation in accord‐
ance with 23.2.2
A.7.7.2.6   Documentation stored in electronic media can
become obsolete, for example, 5.25 in. and 3.5 in. disks and
tape drives are not supported by current technology. Updating
the stored media to current technology concerns the programs
used to operate them, and the computer or hardware used to
interface to the system installed. Thus, it is necessary to ensure
that all components are still compatible with the installed
system.
A.7.7.3.2   It is recognized that there are circumstances in
which the security and protection of some system documents
will require measures other than that prescribed in this Code.
Since a common expectation of a mass notification system is to
function during security and/or terrorist events, it could be
crucial that system design be protected.
Where such conditions have been identified, the stakehold‐
ers should clearly identify what and how system documents
should be maintained to satisfy the integrity of this section
regarding reviews, future service, modifications, and system
support.
Due to freedom of information laws allowing for public
access to documents submitted to and retained by code offi‐
cials, it could be necessary for secure documents to be reviewed
by code officials at alternate locations. Such conditions should
be identified by the stakeholders and discussed with the author‐
ities having jurisdiction(s) in advance.
A.7.8.1.1   See Section 7.2 for the minimum documentation
requirements.
A.7.8.2(1)   Examples of completed record of completion forms
are shown in Figure A.7.8.2(1)(a) through Figure A.7.8.2(1)
(f).
A.7.8.2(2)   Figure 7.8.2(g) through Figure 7.8.2(l) are sample
forms intended to reflect the general information that should
be provided as part of a system inspection and test report, but
they are not intended to mandate a specific format for the
report. A report format customized to the specific system
configuration, devices, appliances, and system functions being
tested meets the intent of the requirement.
A.10.3.3   This requirement does not apply to notification
appliance circuits.
A.10.3.5(1)   The requirement of 10.3.5(1) does not preclude
transfer to secondary supply at less than 85 percent of nominal
primary voltage, provided the requirements of 10.6.7 are met.
Δ A.10.4.1   Fire alarm specifications can include some or all of
the following:
(1) Address of the protected premises
(2) Owner of the protected premises
(3) Authority having jurisdiction
(4) Applicable codes, standards, and other design criteria to
which the system is required to comply
(5) Type of building construction and occupancy
(6) Fire department response point(s) and annunciator
location(s)
(7) Type of fire alarm system to be provided
(8) Calculations (e.g., secondary supply and voltage drop
calculations)
(9) Type(s) of fire alarm initiating devices, supervisory alarm
initiating devices, and evacuation notification appliances
to be provided
(10) Intended area(s) of coverage
(11) Complete list of detection, signaling, and annunciator
zones
(12) Complete list of emergency control functions
(13) Complete sequence of operations detailing all inputs
and outputs
N A.10.4.4   Switches and visible indicators referenced in 10.4.4
are those intended for use by the system owner and first
responders. It is not the intent of the committee to require all
control unit diagnostic indicators or configuration switches
used by the installation/service personnel required to be instal‐
led within these limits. Control units that do not have such
operator interface are not bound by this requirement;
however; the installer should consider best practice for ease in
serviceability.
A.10.4.5   The control units that are to be protected are those
that provide notification of a fire to the occupants and
responders. The term control unit does not include equipment
such as annunciators and addressable devices. Requiring smoke
detection at the transmitting equipment is intended to increase
the probability that an alarm signal will be transmitted to a
supervising station prior to that transmitting equipment being
disabled due to the fire condition.
CAUTION: Exception No. 1 to 10.4.5 permits the use of a
heat detector if ambient conditions are not suitable for smoke
detection. It is important to also evaluate whether the area is
suitable for the control unit.
Where the area or room containing the control unit is provi‐
ded with total smoke detection coverage, additional smoke
detection is not required to protect the control unit. Where
total smoke detection coverage is not provided, the Code
intends that only one smoke detector is required at the control
unit even when the area of the room would require more than
one detector if installed according to the spacing rules in
Chapter 17. The intent of selective coverage is to address the
specific location of the equipment.
The location of the required detection should be in accord‐
ance with 17.7.3.2.1.
A.10.5.3   It is not the intent to require personnel performing
simple inspections or operational tests of initiating devices to
require factory training or special certification, provided such
personnel can demonstrate knowledge in these areas.

A.10.5.3.1   The requirements for inspection personnel can
vary depending on the type of inspection being performed.
The purpose for initial and reacceptance inspections is to
ensure compliance with approved design documents and to
ensure installation in accordance with this Code and other
required installation standards. Therefore, the acceptance
inspection should be performed by someone who is familiar
with the specific requirements, the design documents, and the
applicable codes and standards. This implies that acceptance
inspections should be performed by the persons or entities
responsible for the system design and by authorities having
jurisdiction.
Once a system or a change to a system has been accepted,
the inspection needs also change. The purpose for periodic
inspections is to assure that obvious damages or changes that
might affect the system operability are visually identified. Those
persons performing periodic system inspections might or
might not be familiar with all the specific system design goals
and requirements. While many periodic inspections could
uncover design faults, the intent of this Code is for such prob‐
lems to be discovered at the acceptance inspection. The Code
does not intend to require persons performing periodic inspec‐
tions necessarily to be knowledgeable or qualified for inspect‐
ing and verifying the design of a system.
A.10.5.3.2   Testing personnel knowledge should include equip‐
ment selection, placement, and installation requirements of
this Code and the manufacturer's published documentation.
A.10.5.3.4(1)   Factory training and certification is intended to
allow an individual to service equipment only for which he or
she has specific brand and model training.
A.10.5.3.4(2)   Nationally recognized fire alarm certification
programs might include those programs offered by the Inter‐
national Municipal Signal Association (IMSA), National Insti‐
tute for Certification in Engineering Technologies (NICET),
and the Electronic Security Association (ESA). NOTE: These
organizations and the products or services offered by them
have not been independently verified by the NFPA, nor have
the products or services been endorsed or certified by the
NFPA or any of its technical committees.

A.10.5.3.4(3)   Licenses and certifications offered at a state or
local level are intended to recognize those individuals who
have demonstrated a minimum level of technical competency
in the area of fire alarm servicing.
A.10.5.3.5   This is not intended to require certification where
it is not offered or required by the manufacturer.
A.10.5.5.1(2)   An example of an organization providing alarm
monitoring operator training is the Central Station Alarm Asso‐
ciation (CSAA). Note that this reference is for information
purposes only, information concerning the product or service
has been provided by the manufacturer or other outside sour‐
ces, and the information concerning the product or service has
not been independently verified nor has the product or service
been endorsed or certified by the NFPA or any of its technical
committees.
A.10.5.6.4.2(2)   An example of an organization providing
public emergency alarm reporting system certification is the
International Municipal Signal Association. Note that this refer‐
ence is for information purposes only. Information concerning
the product or service has been provided by the manufacturer
or other outside sources, and the information concerning the
product or service has not been independently verified, nor
has the product or service been endorsed or certified by NFPA
or any of its technical committees.
A.10.5.6.4.2(4)   Factory training and certification are intended
to allow individuals to service only the equipment for which
they have specific brand and model training.
N A.10.6.1   Exceptions exist in Chapter 23 for low-power wireless
systems and in Chapter 29 for household low-power wireless
systems and smoke alarms.
N A.10.6.4   ESS classifications are found in NFPA 111. Previous
editions of NFPA 72 referenced uninterruptible power supplies
(UPS) systems, which is one type of an ESS.
N A.10.6.5.1.2   Multiple pieces of system equipment can be
connected to a branch circuit, subject to the current capacity of
the circuit. It is not intended that a branch circuit be limited to
a single piece of equipment. It is not intended that the circuit
supply power to other than system equipment. For example, a
branch circuit could power both a fire alarm control unit and
an NAC power supply, but it could not power both a fire alarm
control unit and a sprinkler system air compressor.
Δ A.10.6.5.2.2   The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that
circuit disconnecting means for fire alarm and signaling
systems are readily identifiable so that users will not mistakenly
disconnect the power to the system or so that they can quickly
disconnect power without having to search the electrical panel‐
board chart to identify the circuit. The intent of this require‐
ment is not to require specific text for identification. Marking
can include one of the following:
(1) “FIRE ALARM” for fire alarm systems
(2) “EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS” for emergency
communications systems
(3) “FIRE ALARM/ECS” for combination fire alarm and
emergency communications systems
(4) “CARBON MONOXIDE” for carbon monoxide detection
systems
It would be acceptable to show the text using upper and/or
lower case, such as “fire alarm, ” or “Fire Alarm,” or “FIRE
ALARM.”
A.10.6.6   Where a computer system of any kind is used to
receive and process alarm or supervisory signals, an ESS with
sufficient capacity to operate the system until the secondary
supply is capable of operating the fire alarm system might be
required in order to prevent signal loss or a greater than 10-
second signal delay.
ESS equipment often contains an internal bypass arrange‐
ment to supply the load directly from the line. These internal
bypass arrangements are a potential source of failure. ESS
equipment also requires periodic maintenance. It is, therefore,
necessary to provide a means of promptly and safely bypassing
and isolating the ESS equipment from all power sources while
maintaining continuity of power supply to the equipment
normally supplied by the ESS.
A.10.6.7.2   When a fire alarm system is used to alert occupants,
the associated premises are generally evacuated during
prolonged power outages. When this is not the case, as in
emergency shelters or certain government facilities, additional
secondary power should be required to address a more
prolonged outage. These outages might be expected to result
from weather or earthquake in locations subject to these
events. Reasonable judgment should be employed when requir‐
ing additional secondary capacity.
When a fire alarm system is used to protect property, the
associated premises might be vacant for prolonged periods
(weekend, long holiday) or in very remote locations. When this
is the case, and when the risk of loss is significant, additional
secondary power should be required to address a more
prolonged outage. These outages might be expected to result
from weather or earthquake in locations subject to these
events. Reasonable judgment should be employed when requir‐
ing additional secondary capacity.
Δ A.10.6.7.2.1.1   The 20-percent safety margin is intended to
address normal aging effects on battery capacity. As a battery
ages, rated capacity will decrease to 80 percent, which is consid‐
ered the end of service life. As a minimum, a 20-percent correc‐
tion factor should be applied for aging to ensure the battery
can meet its current demand at the end of service life. At initial
installation, battery capacity can be as low as 90 percent and
should gradually increase when it is subjected to several deep
discharge/charging cycles or when it remains on float-charge
for several weeks. For additional information on battery sizing
considerations refer to IEEE 485, Recommended Practice for Sizing
Lead-Acid Batteries for Stationary Applications.
N A.10.6.7.2.3   For combination systems, such as a combination
carbon monoxide and fire alarm system, where the carbon
monoxide notification appliances are capable of being oper‐
ated separately from the fire alarm system notification applian‐
ces, only the carbon monoxide notification appliances are
required to operate for 12 hours.
A.10.6.7.3   The secondary power supply is not required to
supply power to the fire alarm system through parallel distribu‐
tion paths. Automatic transfer switches are commonly used to
allow secondary power to be supplied over the same distribu‐
tion system as the primary power.
The generator does not need to be dedicated to the fire
alarm system.

A.10.6.8.1   Examples include the following:
(1) A building lighting power supply required for illumina‐
tion in a required video image smoke detection means
(2) A notification appliance circuit power supply located
remotely
(3) A power supply for transmitter required to transmit
signals off premises
(4) Power over ethernet (PoE), where provided for control
units, circuit interfaces, or other equipment essential to
system operation, and located remotely from the main
control unit
A.10.6.9.2   Because digital alarm communicator systems estab‐
lish communications channels between the protected premises
and the central station via the public switched telephone
network, the requirement to supervise circuits between the
protected premises and the central station (see 12.6.1 and
12.6.2) is considered to be met if the communications channel
is periodically tested in accordance with 26.6.4.1.5.
A.10.6.9.3   This requirement is intended to prevent all of the
supervising station alarm systems in a given geographic area
from transmitting simultaneous trouble signals (and over‐
whelming the associated supervising stations) in the event of a
widespread power failure. A trouble signal is not intended to
be transmitted if primary power is restored within the time
delay.
Δ A.10.6.10   The valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) battery type
of rechargeable battery is currently used in protected premises
applications.
This rechargeable-type battery is generally used in place of
primary batteries in applications that have a relatively high
current drain or that require the extended standby capability
of much lower currents. The nominal voltage of a single
starved electrolyte cell is 2 volts, and the battery is available in
multiples of 2 volts (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 12). Batteries should be stored
according to the battery manufacturer’s published instructions.
These batteries are often incorrectly referred to as “sealed lead-
acid,” “gel” or “maintenance-free batteries.”
There are two technologies available. The most common
type is referred to as “absorbed glass mat” or AGM. In this tech‐
nology, the electrolyte is immobilized by being absorbed into
fiberglass mats that surround the plates. Nearly all VRLA
batteries in use in U.S. fire protection applications are AGM.
The second technology is referred to as gelled electrolyte. In
this technology, the electrolyte is immobilized in a silica gel.
This technology is predominately seen in European applica‐
tions. While some manufacturers refer to the battery as a gel
battery in the literature, this needs to be confirmed by the tech‐
nician. Gel batteries require higher float voltages than AGM,
and floating an AGM battery at gel voltages will shorten the
battery life.
A.10.6.10.3.4   The circuitry and methods for charging batter‐
ies of various types are to be evaluated by a nationally recog‐
nized testing laboratory to ensure they are appropriate for the
purpose. During primary power use, batteries are trickle-
charged if they are off-line and waiting to be put under load in
the event of a loss of power.
Float-charged batteries are fully charged and connected
across the output of the rectifiers to smooth the output and to
serve as a standby source of power in the event of a loss of line
power. Other charging methods are used to restore capacity to
a battery after it has been utilized during a loss of primary
power.
A.10.7.3   Mass notification signals might, at times, be more
important to the building or area occupants than the fire alarm
signal. Stakeholders should perform a risk analysis in accord‐
ance with 24.3.12 to determine which, if any, messages should
receive priority.
A.10.7.9   In addition, the override of circuits should be indica‐
ted at the control panel of each system to ensure signals are
restored to normal.
A.10.10.4   Control unit signals can be audible, visual, or both
for any particular function. Some older systems used only audi‐
ble indicators that had to be coded for users to know what the
signal meant. Where a control unit uses both audible and visual
indicators, the purpose of the audible signal is to get someone's
attention. In large system configurations, there might be multi‐
ple control units with audible signals. Also, there might be
several different functions requiring an audible alert as a part
of the whole signal. Thus, there could be several different audi‐
ble signals. It is not the intent of this Code to have separate and
distinct audible signals where clear visual distinction provides
the user with the needed information. Visual signals, whether a
lamp with a text label, an LCD screen, a computer monitor, or
other textual visual appliances, are better forms of human
interface.
A.10.10.5   A valve supervisory, a low-pressure switch, or
another device intended to cause a supervisory signal when
activated should not be connected in series with the end-of-line
supervisory device of initiating device circuits, unless a distinc‐
tive signal, different from a trouble signal, is indicated.
A.10.11.1   Activation of an initiating device is usually the
instant at which a complete digital signal is achieved at the
device, such as a contact closure. For smoke detectors or other
automatic initiating devices, which can involve signal process‐
ing and analysis of the signature of fire phenomena, activation
means the instant when the signal analysis requirements are
completed by the device or fire alarm control unit software.
A separate fire alarm control unit contemplates a network of
fire alarm control units forming a single large system as
defined in Section 23.8.
For some analog initiating devices, activation is the moment
that the fire alarm control unit interprets that the signal from
an initiating device has exceeded the alarm threshold program‐
med into the fire alarm control unit.
For smoke detectors working on a system with alarm verifica‐
tion, where the verification function is performed in the fire
alarm control unit, the moment of activation of smoke detec‐
tors is sometimes determined by the fire alarm control unit.
It is not the intent of this paragraph to dictate the time
frame for the local fire safety devices to complete their func‐
tion, such as fan wind-down time, door closure time, or eleva‐
tor travel time.
A.10.11.2   The intent of this requirement is to ensure that
persons who are deaf or hard of hearing are alerted to seek
additional information regarding an emergency situa‐
tion. Persons who are deaf or hard of hearing are not always
alerted by the loudspeakers that provide evacuation tones or
voice instructions. It is intended that the loudspeakers and

visual notification appliances located in the same area be acti‐
vated together whenever tones, recorded voice instructions, or
live voice instructions are being provided. (SIG-ECS)
A.10.11.4   The recommended coded signal designations for
buildings that have four floors and multiple basements are
provided in Table A.10.11.4.
A.10.11.6   Resetting of alarm signals should not require the
simultaneous operation of multiple reset switches or the
disconnection of any wiring or equipment to reset the alarm
condition.
A.10.12   It is the intent that both visual and audible appliances
are shut off when the notification appliance silence feature is
activated on the fire alarm control unit.
Per the ADA, it is important not to provide conflicting
signals for the hearing or visually impaired.
A.10.12.2   Where it is desired to deactivate the notification
appliances for fire service operations inside the building and
signal evacuated occupants that an alarm is still present, it is
recommended that a separate non-silenceable notification
zone be provided on the exterior of the building. The audible
and visual notification appliances located at the building
entrances could serve as a warning to prevent occupant re-
entry.
A.10.15.9   The purpose of automatic trouble re-sound is to
remind owners, or those responsible for the system, that the
system remains in a fault condition. A secondary benefit is to
possibly alert occupants of the building that the fire alarm
system is in a fault condition.
A.10.15.10.7   In large, campus-style arrangements with propri‐
etary supervising stations monitoring protected premises
systems, and in other situations where off-premises monitoring
achieves the desired result, the authority having jurisdiction is
permitted to allow the reactivation to occur only at the super‐
vising station. Approval by the authority having jurisdiction is
required so it can consider all fire safety issues and make a
determination that there are procedures in place to ensure
that the intent is met; in other words, someone is available to
take action to correct the problem.
A.10.16.2   The operability of controlled mechanical equip‐
ment (e.g., smoke and fire dampers, elevator recall arrange‐
ments, and door holders) should be verified by periodic
testing. Failure to test and properly maintain controlled
mechanical equipment can result in operational failure during
an emergency, with potential consequences up to and includ‐
ing loss of life.
A.10.17.2   Initially this requirement was meant to apply to noti‐
fication appliance circuits (NACs) emanating from a single fire
alarm control unit and did not contemplate the use of NAC

extender panels. Acknowledging the control circuit concept
allows NAC extender panels and relays to be connected to a
control circuit.
A.10.18.3   The primary purpose of annunciation is to enable
responding personnel to quickly and accurately determine the
status of equipment or emergency control functions that might
affect the safety of occupants.
A.10.18.5   Fire alarm system annunciation should, as a mini‐
mum, be sufficiently specific to identify a fire alarm signal in
accordance with the following:
(1) If a floor exceeds 22,500 ft 2 (2090 m 2) in area, the floor
should be subdivided into detection zones of 22,500 ft 2
(2090 m2) or less, consistent with the existing smoke and
fire barriers on the floor.
(2) If a floor exceeds 22,500 ft2 (2090 m2) in area and is undi‐
vided by smoke or fire barriers, detection zoning should
be determined on a case-by-case basis in consultation with
the authority having jurisdiction.
(3) Waterflow switches on sprinkler systems that serve multi‐
ple floors, areas exceeding 22,500 ft 2 (2090 m 2), or areas
inconsistent with the established detection system zoning
should be annunciated individually.
(4) In-duct smoke detectors on air-handling systems that
serve multiple floors, areas exceeding 22,500 ft 2
(2090 m 2), or areas inconsistent with the established
detection system zoning should be annunciated individu‐
ally.
(5) If a floor area exceeds 22,500 ft 2 (2090 m 2), additional
zoning should be provided. The length of any zone
should not exceed 300 ft (91 m) in any direction. If the
building is provided with automatic sprinklers through‐
out, the area of the alarm zone should be permitted to
coincide with the allowable area of the sprinkler zone.
A.10.19.1   Amplifiers generally require significant power
regardless of load. To reduce the secondary power demand,
there is no requirement to monitor the integrity of amplifiers
during non-alarm operation on secondary power. This allows
the amplifiers to be shut down while the system is operating on
secondary power until an alarm occurs. When an alarm occurs,
monitoring of integrity must resume so that an operator is
aware of current conditions and so that any backup amplifiers
can be engaged.
Backup amplifying and evacuation signal–generating equip‐
ment is recommended with automatic transfer upon primary
equipment failure to ensure prompt restoration of service in
the event of equipment failure.
A.10.21   The term impairments encompasses a broad range of
circumstances wherein a system or portion thereof is taken out
of service for a variety of reasons. Systems are routinely
impaired to allow hot work (e.g., open flame operations) to be
performed in areas with automatic detection, construction,
painting, and so forth, as well as to conduct normal system
maintenance and testing. Impairments can be limited to
specific initiating devices and/or functions (e.g., disconnecting
the supervising station connection during system testing), or
they can involve taking entire systems or portions of systems
out of service. Section 10.21 is intended to help building
owners control impairments of the system(s) in their build‐
ing(s) and to ensure that systems are restored to full operation
and/or returned to service afterward.

Additional requirements for impairments and out-of-service
conditions are in 14.2.2.2.
A.10.21.4   It is important for the authority having jurisdiction,
typically the local fire official, to be informed when systems
have been out of service for more than 8 hours so that appro‐
priate measures can be taken. The term out of service is meant to
refer to the entire system or a substantial portion thereof.
A.10.21.5   The need for mitigating measures is typically deter‐
mined on a case-by-case basis. This considers the building,
occupancy type, nature and duration of impairment, building
occupancy level during impairment period, active work being
conducted on the fire alarm system during the impairment,
condition of other fire protection systems and features (i.e.,
sprinklers, structural compartmentation, etc.), and hazards and
assets at risk.
Appropriate mitigating measures range from simple occu‐
pant notification to full-time fire watch. Determining factors
vary from testing-related impairments and maintenance activi‐
ties during normal business through extensive impairments to
high-value, high-hazard situations.
A.10.22   See 3.3.314 for the definitions of unwanted alarms.
A.12.2.1   In the 2007 edition of NFPA 72 , initiating device
circuit, signaling line circuit, and notification appliance circuit
performance class/style tables were rooted in “copper” wiring
methods. Fire alarm control units use new communications
technologies, such as Ethernet, fiber optics, and wireless, which
do not fit in the “copper” wiring methods.
Δ A.12.2.3.2   Fire alarm systems include fire detection and alarm
notification, guard’s tour, sprinkler waterflow, and sprinkler
supervisory systems. Circuits controlled and powered by the fire
alarm system include circuits for the control of building
systems safety functions, elevator capture, elevator shutdown,
door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and
damper control, and fan shutdown, but only where these
circuits are powered by and controlled by the fire alarm system.
[70:760.1 Informational Note No. 1]
Class 1, 2, and 3 circuits are defined in Article 725 (of
NFPA 70). [70:760.1 Informational Note No. 2]
A.12.2.3.3   It is important for the intended functionality of
circuit integrity cable or electrical circuit protective systems to
follow manufacturer’s installation instructions. An electrical
circuit protective system has detailed installation requirements,
and additional requirements can be found in the manufactur‐
er’s installation instructions, NFPA 70  or the listing organiza‐
tions' guide information.
A.12.2.3.4   In the event of an introduction of a fault and subse‐
quent alarm condition, operational ability should be restored
within 200 seconds, and the alarm condition received at the
fire alarm control unit is to be within 10 seconds after the expi‐
ration of the 200 seconds. Any subsequent alarms initiated after
the initial 200-second window should be actuated in accord‐
ance with 10.11.1.
A.12.2.4.3   Technologies that do not use metallic conductors
(e.g., wireless or optical fiber) are not affected by ground
connections.
A.12.3   The intent of the circuit designations is not to create a
hierarchal ranking; rather it is to provide guidance on the
levels of performance.
Users of the Chapter 12 designations should review whether
there are other abnormal conditions not specified in Chap‐
ter 12 that the pathways need to annunciate and operate
through for their application.
A.12.3.1   Fiber-optic or wireless pathways are examples of
Class A circuitry not impaired by earth ground connection or
short-circuits and therefore do not annunciate those conditions
as a fault.
A.12.3.3   Class C is intended to describe technologies that
supervise the communication pathway by polling or continuous
communication “handshaking,” such as the following:
(1) Fire alarm control unit or supervising station connections
to a wired LAN, WAN, or Internet
(2) Fire alarm control unit or supervising station connections
to a wireless LAN, WAN, and Internet
(3) Fire alarm control unit digital alarm communicator trans‐
mitter or supervising station digital alarm communicator
receiver connections to the public switched telephone
network
Individual pathway segments are not required to be moni‐
tored. Supervision is accomplished by end-to-end communica‐
tions.
A.12.3.4   Class D is intended to describe pathways that are not
supervised but have a fail-safe operation that performs the
intended function when the connection is lost. Examples of
such pathways include the following:
(1) Power to door holders where interruption of the power
results in the door closing
(2) Power to locking hardware that release upon an open
circuit or fire alarm operation
A.12.3.5   Class E is intended to describe pathways that do not
require supervision as described in Section 12.6.
Δ A.12.3.6(1)   The Class N pathway designation is added to
specifically address the use of modern network infrastructure
when used in fire alarm and emergency communication
systems.
Class N networks can be specified for ancillary functions but
are not required for supplemental reporting described in
23.12.4. [See Figure A.23.12.4.]
Ethernet network devices are addressable but with an impor‐
tant distinction from device addresses on a traditional SLC
multi-drop loop. A device with an Ethernet address is, in most
cases, a physical endpoint connected to a dedicated cable.
Traditional SLC devices are all wired on the same communica‐
tion line (in parallel), similar to an old party-line telephone
system. By comparison, Ethernet’s network switches direct each
data packet to its intended recipient device like our modern
phone systems.

Class N uses redundant paths as a means to compensate for
Ethernet wiring that does not report a single connection to
ground, a basic requirement of Class B. Thus, the physical sepa‐
ration of Class A and Class X, and equipment redundancy
described in 12.3.7, is not inherently required of Class N. In
other words, failure of a single switch is permitted take down a
class N segment and is only required to report the loss of
communication. Where redundant path segments are intended
to have survivability similar to Class A or Class X, the physical
separation requirements and overall equipment redundancy
must be specified in addition to the Class N designation.
As a visual model, Class N could be likened to a redundant
pathway backbone, allowed to have Class C branch paths to
single endpoint devices. Therefore, every effort is made in this
section to clearly distinguish the single endpoint device from
the transport equipment required to have redundant paths.
Class N requires redundant, monitored pathway segments to
and from control equipment (fire alarm control units, ACUs,
or ECCUs) where any interruption in communications could
potentially affect multiple endpoint devices. Typically, intercon‐
nected communications equipment such as Ethernet switches,
wireless repeaters, or media converters are used in combina‐
tion to create pathways. Chapter 12 describes the required
behavior of Class N pathways. All equipment must meet the
requirements of other chapters in NFPA 72 (such as, but not
limited to, requirements pertaining to secondary power
supplies, equipment listings, and environment conditions).
Redundant pathways, isolated from ground, are actually
common practice in robust Ethernet designs. Managed
network switches commonly have specific uplink ports that are
intended for load sharing and allow two parallel connections.
For compliance with Class N, a trouble must be reported if
either of these connections fails. [See Figure A.12.3.6(1)(a) and
Figure A.12.3.6(1)(b).]
Class N pathways can use metallic conductor communica‐
tions cable, such as a 100 ohm balanced twisted pair (e.g., Cate‐
gory 5E), including single-pair or multi-pair cable, or other
communications media, such as optical fiber cable or wireless
transmission, or a combination of two or more such transport
mediums.
Where a conductor-based media is used for Class N, the
intention is not to monitor faults on individual conductors but
rather to monitor the operational capability and performance
of the pathway as a whole. Similar to Class C, end-to-end verifi‐
cation is used in Class N.
Primary and required redundant pathways are independ‐
ently and continuously verified for their ability to support end-
to-end communications to and from each endpoint device and
its associated control equipment. Pathway segments that service
more than one device must have at least one verified redun‐
dant pathway segment. Should any primary pathway segment
fail, communication is supported by the redundant pathway
segment(s.) Failure of either a primary or redundant pathway
will indicate a trouble.
Redundant pathway segments are generally independent
and do not normally share media with the primary pathways.
However, there are exceptions, such as different frequencies
for wireless components, or ring topologies. [See Figure
A.12.3.6(5).]
A Class N network can be made more reliable with physically
distinct pathway segments (i.e., an alternate conduit, or cable
tray route, or wireless transmission frequency range, or a
combination of distinct media). In addition to the required
primary segments and redundant segments, a Class N pathway
is permitted to have nonrequired segments. [See Figure
A.12.3.6(1)(c).] Additional nonrequired pathway segments are
allowed to be connected and not independently monitored for
integrity as long as two paths are monitored to meet the redun‐
dancy requirement of Class N.
Traditionally, NFPA has used the word device for input
components and the term appliance for components used in
notification. With respect to Class N, the term device includes
appliances and other intelligent, addressable components that
perform a programmable input or output function. Examples
of Class N devices include the following:
(1) Input components such as alarm initiating modules
switches and sensors
(2) Output components such as output modules, Ethernet
loudspeakers (i.e., IEEE 802.3af PoE loudspeakers), intel‐
ligent visual notification appliances (strobes) , textual
signage, and intelligent audio amplifiers
Transmission equipment components (e.g., media convert‐
ers, Ethernet switches, patch panels, cross-connects) are
connected to the Class N pathway merely to transport instruc‐
tions between other equipment. As such, they are not consid‐
ered devices with respect to Class N pathways.
The audio amplifier listed above is an example of an
addressable device that can receive a digital audio input from
the Class N pathway and then provide a notification appliance
circuit (NAC) output with Class A, B, or X pathways. Other
endpoint devices can similarly provide alternate class pathways
for visual notification appliances (strobes) (NACs) or initiating
devices (IDCs). From the perspective of the Class N pathway,
communications terminate at this endpoint device. However,
since these types of endpoints can support multiple notification
appliance devices or initiating devices, path segments are
subject to the redundant pathway requirement unless protec‐
ted in an enclosure or raceway less than 20 ft (6 m) in length.
(See 12.6.9.)[See Figure A.12.3.6(1)(c).]
Class N connections between control equipment are
required to have redundant monitored pathway segments if a
failure of a primary pathway segment in between control equip‐
ment could impair the operation of the control equipment.
[See Figure A.12.3.6(1)(d).]
Class N is also permitted to include dual port devices that
provide both transmission and input/output functions.
Endpoint devices can have multiple connection ports and
support dual pathway segment connections; thus the term
endpoint device  is not intended to prohibit more than one
connection to a device. Even with dual connections, where
other devices depend on the path, primary and redundant
paths are required. But, where an endpoint device has two
connection ports, and when a secondary nonrequired connec‐
tion is added, there is no requirement to separately supervise
the nonrequired redundant pathway segment. [See Figure
A.12.3.6(1)(e).]

A.12.3.6(4)   Operational conditions of the pathway include
factors such as latency, throughput, response time, arrival rate,
utilization, bandwidth, and loss. Life safety equipment connec‐
ted to a Class N network actively monitors some or all of the
pathway’s operational conditions so that an improperly instal‐
led or configured pathway or a subsequently degraded pathway
or segment is detected by the life safety equipment and repor‐
ted as a trouble. The trouble condition is reported when opera‐
tional conditions of the pathway(s) have deteriorated to the
point where the equipment is no longer capable of meeting its
minimum performance requirements, even if some level of
communication to devices is still maintained. Performance
requirements include the activation of an alarm within
10 seconds, the reporting of a trouble signal within
200 seconds, and delivery of audio messages with required
intelligibility. End-to-end communications might be opera‐
tional under system idle conditions, but in the event of an
alarm, the increased load on a degraded pathway could cause a
partial or complete failure to deliver required life safety signals.
Such predictable failure must be actively detected and repor‐
ted.
A.12.3.6(5)   Devices with dual path connections are permitted
to be connected in a daisy-chain of devices on a ring. Again,
where Class N pathway segments support multiple devices, veri‐
fied redundant pathway segment(s) are required. This can be
accomplished with a ring topology, as long as each segment of
the ring is verified as functional, and the failure of any one
segment does not result in the loss of functionality of more

than one device. In this arrangement, primary and redundant
pathway segments share the same media, and provide two
possible directions of communications in a ring topology [see
Figure A.12.3.6(5)] . This daisy-chain configuration is also
permitted between multiple control units that require verified
primary and redundant pathway segments.
A.12.3.8   A goal of 12.3.8 is to provide adequate separation
between the outgoing and return cables. This separation is
required to help ensure protection of the cables from physical
damage. The recommended minimum separation to prevent
physical damage is 12 in. (300 mm) where the cable is installed
vertically and 48 in. (1.22 m) where the cable is installed hori‐
zontally.
A.12.3.8.1(3)   This exception would not permit an entire room
of emergency control function interface devices controlled by
the fire alarm system to be installed on a circuit where the feed
and return legs are installed in the same raceway for rooms
smaller than 1000 ft2 (93 m2) in area.
Where a circuit enters a room that contains emergency
control function interface devices (e.g., control modules/relays
connected to and programmed to shut down HVAC units and
other fire and life safety control functions), loss of both “legs”
of this circuit could disable important fire and life safety
control functions that might be essential for prevention of
circulation of smoke or another required operation, such as
elevator recall functions.
A.12.4   The intent of the pathway survivability designation is to
provide options for the protection of the pathway circuits and
not to create a hierarchical ranking. Other chapters within
NFPA 72  or other code-making jurisdictions can select the
survivability option that best meets their needs.
A.12.4.3   Methods of survivability protection might alternate
within a protected premise. For example, 2-hour fire-resistive
cable might extend from a 2-hour fire-resistance-rated enclo‐
sure.
Fire alarm system notification appliances, control modules,
jacks, and initiating devices are not capable of resisting attack
by fire. Connecting these devices to circuits that require surviv‐
ability and span multiple zones or floors, will result in a circuit
that is no longer survivable. For example, two-way, in-building
communications system (fire fighter’s telephone) jacks that are
connected to a circuit serving multiple floors could be shorted
by the fire. It is recommended that a Level 2 or Level 3 surviva‐
ble circuit serving multiple zones or floors be installed as
Class X or Class N or those circuits be designed to serve a
single fire zone.
A.12.4.3(4)   A performance-based alternative is needed
because it is possible to construct a nonsprinklered,

Type V(000) building that employs relocation or partial evacua‐
tion (e.g., a single-story ambulatory health care occupancy)
that would not warrant either a 2-hour fire-resistive-rated enclo‐
sure or a 2-hour cable. Examples of performance alternatives
that might be considered in a design for survivability are a stra‐
tegic application of Class A, Class X, or Class N segments and
also wireless communications pathways.
N A.12.4.4   See A.12.4.3.
A.12.4.4(4)   A performance-based alternative is needed
because it is possible to construct a sprinklered single-story
Type V(111) or multistory Type II(111) building that employs
relocation or partial evacuation (e.g., a health care occupancy)
that would not warrant either a 2-hour fire-resistive-rated enclo‐
sure or a 2-hour cable (a 1-hour enclosure would suffice).
Examples of performance alternatives that might be consid‐
ered in a design for survivability are a strategic application of
Class A, Class X, or Class N segments and also wireless commu‐
nications pathways.
A.12.5   Shared pathway designations propose a list of shared
pathways, some of which are only allowable for nonrequired
functions. Other sections of this Code determine which of the
shared pathways are allowed to be used as paths for required
fire alarm signaling. Refer to 23.8.2.6 for shared communica‐
tions requirements.
A.12.5.1   In a Shared Pathway Level 0, common equipment
can be used to establish life safety and non–life safety pathways.
A.12.5.2   In a Shared Pathway Level 1, common equipment
can be used to establish life safety and non–life safety pathways.
A.12.5.3   In a Shared Pathway Level 2, common equipment
can be used to establish life safety and non–life safety pathways.
A.12.5.4   In a Shared Pathway Level 3, life safety equipment is
not shared with equipment of non–life safety systems.
A.12.6   The provision of a double loop or other multiple path
conductor or circuit to avoid electrical monitoring is not
acceptable.
A.12.6.8   This Code does not have jurisdiction over the moni‐
toring integrity of conductors within equipment, devices, or
appliances.
A.12.7   The nomenclature described in Section 12.7 can be
found on drawings, specifications, and the actual installed
circuits. Some examples of the nomenclature are X.2.3, A, B.3.
A.14.2.1.1   Initial and re-acceptance inspections are
performed to ensure compliance with approved design docu‐
ments whatever the quality or origin. This involves inspection
to ensure that the correct equipment has been used and prop‐
erly located and installed. Ensuring compliance helps to assure
both operational reliability and mission reliability. This concept
applies to any type of system, not just fire alarm and signaling
systems. At this stage of a system’s life, the responsibilities for
such inspections rest with the designers of the systems and with
the various applicable authorities having jurisdiction.
A.14.2.1.2   If a system is designed to meet a specific mission or
set of goals, then operational testing will assure that the system
has mission reliability. For example, during acceptance testing,
the design ambient noise level might not be present. Authori‐
ties having jurisdiction and technicians should not be trying to
achieve the +5/15 dB or +5/10 dB requirements at acceptance,
as they might not know what the maximum average or peak
noise levels are. They need only measure the system and deter‐
mine if it meets the required design level. Therefore, the
design level needs to be documented and communicated to
them.
Acceptance and re-acceptance testing includes proper opera‐
tion, and non-operation, of the fire alarm or signaling system’s
ability to properly interface to other systems. The best way to
ensure a proper interface operation is to observe the actual
operation of the interfaced system. However, exercising an
emergency control function every time a related initiating
device is actuated might not be desirable or practical, or in
some cases may not even be permitted. NFPA 72 permits testing
of the fire alarm or signaling system up to the end point
connection to the interfaced system or emergency control
function. Refer to A.14.4.3.2 Table 14.4.3.2 Item 24.
A.14.2.1.3   Visual inspections contribute to the assurance of
operational and mission reliability but do not ensure either.
A.14.2.1.4   Periodic testing of fire alarm and signaling systems
is not necessarily done as a complete system test. NFPA 72
requires parts of the systems to be tested at different frequen‐
cies. At any one particular test, only a fraction of the system can
be tested. Periodic testing contributes to the assurance of
operational and mission reliability but does not ensure either.
Periodic testing of the interface between a fire alarm or
signaling system in some other system or emergency control
function is permitted by NFPA 72  to be performed without
actually operating the interfaced system or function. Refer to
A.14.4.3.2 Table 14.4.3.2 Item 24.
N A.14.2.2.1.2   Testing should be performed in such a way that
testing personnel can promptly respond to signals as they are
initiated during testing and can ensure that devices are report‐
ing with the correct locations and addresses, programming
errors are not overlooked, ground faults are acknowledged
promptly, and fire and trouble/supervisory signals are respon‐
ded to immediately when signals are not related to the testing
taking place.
A.14.2.3.1   See definition of Ownership in 3.3.195.
A.14.2.3.6   Service personnel should be able to do the follow‐
ing:
(1) Understand the requirements contained in NFPA 72 and
the fire alarm requirements contained in NFPA 70
(2) Understand basic job site safety laws and requirements
(3) Apply troubleshooting techniques, and determine the
cause of fire alarm system trouble conditions
(4) Understand equipment specific requirements, such as
programming, application, and compatibility
(5) Read and interpret fire alarm system design documenta‐
tion and manufacturer’s inspection, testing, and mainte‐
nance guidelines
(6) Properly use tools and test equipment required for test‐
ing and maintenance of fire alarm systems and their
components
(7) Properly apply the test methods required by NFPA 72
A.14.2.4   Prior to any scheduled inspection or testing, the serv‐
ice company should consult with the building or system owner
or the owner’s designated representative. Issues of advance
notification in certain occupancies, including advance notifica‐
tion time, building posting, systems interruption and restora‐

tion, evacuation procedures, accommodation for evacuees, and
other related issues, should be agreed upon by all parties prior
to any inspection or testing.
A.14.2.7.1   As an example, testing of the elevator fire service
and shutdown functions will usually require a coordinated
multi-discipline effort with presence of qualified service person‐
nel for the fire alarm system, the elevator system, and other
building systems. The presence of inspection authorities might
also be needed in some jurisdictions. The development of a test
plan should be considered to ensure that the testing of these
features is accomplished in a coordinated and timely manner.
This plan should also ensure that all appropriate parties and
personnel are present when needed, and that the testing
requirements for both the fire alarm system and the elevator
system are fulfilled. See Section 21.3 and Section 21.4 for
specific elevator emergency control functions.
A.14.2.9   This section provides the option to adopt a
performance-based inspection and testing method as an alter‐
nate means of compliance for Sections 14.3 and 14.4. The
prescriptive test and requirements contained in this Code are
essentially qualitative. Equivalent or superior levels of perform‐
ance can be demonstrated through quantitative performance-
based analyses. This section provides a basis for implementing
and monitoring a performance-based program acceptable
under this option (provided that approval is obtained by the
authority having jurisdiction). The concept of a performance-
based inspection and testing program is to establish the
requirements and frequencies at which inspection and testing
must be performed to demonstrate an acceptable level of
operational reliability. The goal is to balance the inspection
and testing frequency with proven reliability of the system or
component. The goal of a performance-based inspection
program is also to adjust inspection and testing frequencies
commensurate with historical documented equipment
performance and desired reliability. Frequencies of inspection
and testing under a performance-based program might be
extended or reduced from the prescriptive inspection and test‐
ing requirements contained in this Code when continued
inspection and testing has been documented indicating a
higher or lower degree of reliability as compared to the author‐
ity having jurisdiction's expectations of performance. Addi‐
tional program attributes should be considered when adjusting
inspection and testing.
A fundamental requirement of a performance-based
program is the continual monitoring of fire system/component
failure rates and determining if they exceed the maximum
allowable failure rates as agreed upon with the authority having
jurisdiction. The process used to complete this review should
be documented and be repeatable. Coupled with this ongoing
review is a requirement for a formalized method of increasing
or decreasing the frequency of inspection and testing when
systems exhibit either a higher than expected failure rate or an
increase in reliability as a result of a decrease in failures. A
formal process for reviewing the failure rates and increasing or
decreasing the frequency of inspection and testing must be well
documented. Concurrence from the authority having jurisdic‐
tion on the process used to determine test frequencies should
be obtained in advance of any alterations to the inspection and
testing program. The frequency required for future inspections
and tests might be reduced to the next inspection frequency
and maintained there for a period equaling the initial data
review or until the ongoing review indicates that the failure
rate is no longer being exceeded — for example, going from
an annual to a semiannual testing when the failure rate
exceeds the authority having jurisdiction's expectations, or
from annual to every 18 months when the failure trend indi‐
cates an increase in reliability.
See also NFPA 551 for additional guidance.
Δ A.14.2.10   The test plan is intended to clarify exactly what is to
be tested and how it is to be tested. Testing of fire alarm and
signaling systems is often done in a segmented fashion to
accommodate the availability of testing or other personnel or
to minimize the interruption of building operations. Where a
building owner has contracted the performance of inspection,
testing, and maintenance activities to outside entities, the test
plan, what will and will not be tested, should be reviewed by
those parties. Building operations can be affected by testing of
the fire alarm or signaling system itself and by the operation of
emergency control functions actuated by the fire alarm or
signaling system. The boundary of the fire alarm or signaling
system extends up to and includes the emergency control func‐
tion interface device. The testing requirements prescribed in
NFPA 72 for fire alarm and signaling systems end at the emer‐
gency control function interface device. The purpose of the
test plan is to document what devices will and will not actually
be tested.
The testing of emergency control functions, releasing
systems, or interfaced equipment is outside the scope of
NFPA 72. Requirements for testing other systems are found in
other governing laws, codes, or standards. Requirements for
integrated testing of combined systems also fall under the
authority of other governing laws, codes, standards, or author‐
ity having jurisdiction. NFPA 3 provides guidance for such test‐
ing. NFPA 3 recognizes the importance of the development of
an integrated testing plan.
Further information on testing associated with emergency
control functions can be found in Table 14.4.3.2, Item 24 and
its related annex material in A.14.4.3.2.
A.14.3.1   Equipment performance can be affected by building
modifications, occupancy changes, changes in environmental
conditions, device location, physical obstructions, device orien‐
tation, physical damage, improper installation, degree of clean‐
liness, or other obvious problems that might not be indicated
through electrical supervision.
The intent of 14.3.1 is to prevent an inspection being made
at intervals exceeding those allowed by Table 14.3.1. Annual
inspections should be made every 12 months; monthly inspec‐
tions should be made every 30 days, and so forth. For example,
it is not acceptable to conduct an annual inspection in January
of year one, and December of year two (23 month frequency)
just because Table 14.3.1 requires an inspection once each year.
N A.14.3.2   In addition to safety considerations, other reasons for
delaying fire alarm inspections include nationally or regionally
declared disasters, such as pandemics, weather-related emer‐
gencies, or other governmentally recognized disruptions.
A.14.4.2   Reacceptance testing is performed to verify the
proper operation of added or replaced devices, appliances,
emergency control function devices, control equipment, and so
forth. It is not the intent of the committee to unduly burden
the system owner with increased costs for repeated testing of
devices not directly affected by the replacement of devices with
like devices.

For example, if a 2 amp fuse is replaced with another 2 amp
fuse in the fire alarm control unit, verification of the circuit(s)
served by the fused supply is required, but it would not be
necessary to test 10 percent of initiating devices not directly
affected by replacing the fuse. Likewise, it is not necessary to
test all these initiating devices whenever a smoke detector is
replaced with a like smoke detector.
When wiring changes are made to correct improperly super‐
vised circuits, a test of the affected device or appliance is
required, but not a test of 10 percent of initiating devices not
directly affected.
A.14.4.3   Fire alarm system testing can be conducted using
silent testing and the bypassing of emergency control func‐
tions. All input signals should be verified according to the
system matrix of operation to ensure they create the appropri‐
ate outputs. Tests of audible notification appliances and emer‐
gency control functions should be conducted at the conclusion
of satisfactory tests of all inputs.
The intent is to reduce the amount of time spent causing
audible and visual occupant notification during tests in an
occupied building. This reduction will help reduce the nega‐
tive (cry wolf) impact on occupants caused by excessive opera‐
tion of notification appliances. System printouts or history logs
are an effective way of verifying the correct receipt of signals.
However, many outputs such as occupant notification and
emergency control functions are tested for correct operation,
because logs do not necessarily verify operation of the system
output. Operation of audible and visual notification appliances
could be accomplished in a lump sum fashion after all inputs
are proven correct by silent testing. All inputs tested in this
manner must be proved to cause the appropriate signal by veri‐
fying alarm receipt at the controls as each device is actuated.
Manufacturer-specific protocols such as “walk test” or “alarm
bypass” are an acceptable means of testing under this section.
Other methods of mitigating the negative impact include off-
hours tests when the building is not occupied.
A.14.4.3.1   If the authority having jurisdiction strongly suspects
significant deterioration or otherwise improper operation by a
central station, a surprise inspection to test the operation of
the central station should be made, but extreme caution
should be exercised. This test is to be conducted without advis‐
ing the central station. However, the communications center
must be contacted when manual alarms, waterflow alarms, or
automatic fire detection systems are tested so that the fire
department will not respond. In addition, persons normally
receiving calls for supervisory alarms should be notified when
items such as gate valves and functions such as pump power are
tested. Confirmation of the authenticity of the test procedure
should be obtained and should be a matter for resolution
between plant management and the central station.
Δ A.14.4.3.2   Table 14.4.3.2 Item 9(4).  Ohmic testing is a means
to determine the state of health of a VRLA battery’s cells by
measuring some form of a cell’s internal resistance. Typically
ohmic testing equipment uses one of three techniques —
conductance, impedance, or resistance — to make these meas‐
urements.
In simplest technical terms, ohmic technology is based on
Ohm’s Law, which expresses the relationship between volts,
amperes, and ohms in an electrical circuit. Ohmic testing
attempts to use voltage and current to determine the resistive
characteristic of a battery’s cells. As the cells in a battery age
and start to lose capacity, the internal components of the
battery are undergoing a degradation process. The degrada‐
tion of these components (plates, grids, internal connection
straps) within the battery’s cells causes an increased resistance
in the conduction paths of the cell, which in turn causes a
change in the internal ohmic values. A measured increase in
impedance or resistance, or a decrease in conductance, indi‐
cates the battery is losing its ability to produce the energy it was
designed to deliver when called upon to support the connected
loads.
The key to effective application of ohmic testing is the
appropriate trending of test results over time compared to a
baseline or reference value. Studies have demonstrated that an
individual battery produces a unique ohmic "signature" and
the use of ohmic testing equipment to trend changes in this
signature from installation through the life of the battery is the
most effective use of the technology. A program that involves
ohmic testing on a regular interval to note changes in the
battery is a good maintenance practice.
An ohmic baseline reference value is a benchmark value
based on data collected from known good batteries. Reference
values can be determined from site-specific measurement, or
from testing a sample of new healthy batteries, or by using a
generic baseline value to get started.
(1) The best baseline is one established on the installed
battery within three to six months after installation and
trend accordingly using good record keeping. Ideally the
individual ohmic value should be measured at installation
and again after the battery has been on float charge for at
least 72 hours in order for it to reach a high state of stabi‐
lization. These initial “site-specific” values should be
recorded and permanently affixed to the battery as a
baseline for subsequent tests over the life of the battery.
The ohmic value will typically increase for conductance
and decrease for resistance and impedance between the
initial installation and after being on float-charge for 90
to 180 days (10 percent to 15 percent depending on
battery type and size). Six months after installation meas‐
ure and compare the ohmic readings to the readings
taken at installation. Use whichever value is greater for
conductance or lower for resistance and impedance as
the baseline for that particular battery at that site going
forward.
(2) A sample of new healthy batteries in a fully charged state
can be tested to obtain a baseline value representative of
a new battery. A sample size of at least 30 batteries from
one manufacturer with the same make, model, amp-hour
rating, age (within 6 months), and manufacturing lot is
recommended. Record the following information for the
batteries:
(a) Battery manufacturer
(b) Model number
(c) Date of manufacture
(d) Manufacturing lot number (if available)
(e) Battery temperature
(f) Whether or not the battery has had a freshening
charge
(g) Battery voltage
(h) Ohmic test value
Calculate the average ohmic value of the batteries. Do
not include batteries that deviate more than 30 percent
from the average because they could be outside of an

acceptable range. Use the average value as a baseline
starting point for this model battery.
(3) A generic baseline value for a specific battery model can
often be found by contacting the ohmic test equipment
manufacturer or from the battery manufacturer. While it
is important to note that the use of generic reference
values might not be as accurate, it is still possible to iden‐
tify grossly failed batteries and significant changes in
battery condition by applying this method. Generic base‐
line values are typical averages to be used as general
guidelines and should only be used when no other data is
available. When testing older batteries for which no initial
site-specific ohmic value is available, reference values can
be obtained in the following ways:
(a) Contact the equipment or battery manufacturer for
assistance.
(b) Consult your company documentation to see if
reference values were created for the battery you
are testing.
(c) Using ohmic readings of recently installed batteries
of the same manufacturer and model of the battery,
manufacturer and model of the alarm panel/
system, charging circuit, and temperature at time of
measurements, calculate the average ohmic value of
the best 8 to 10 batteries and use this value as a
baseline reference.
As a battery ages and loses capacity, the internal ohmic
values change. Although the change might not be
perfectly consistent over all battery models and sizes,
experience and extensive test data shows that a deviation
of ohmic values from the established baseline by
30 percent or more for conductance and 40 percent or
more for resistance or impedance indicates that the
actual battery capacity has dropped to 80 percent or
lower. (For lead-acid batteries, capacity drops off rapidly
once the 80 percent capacity point is reached in the life‐
time curve, so this is known as the “knee” of the capacity
vs. lifetime curve). This 80 percent capacity is the level at
which battery manufacturers recommend battery replace‐
ment. Figure A.14.4.3.2 illustrates an ohmic trend of a
5-year design life battery with an actual expected service
life of 3 years. Note that while battery Unit #1 still has
good ohmic readings, semiannual measurements show
Unit #2 failing prematurely. For this case, it is desirable to
replace both units at the same time. If one unit fails at
21∕2 years, it is likely the second unit will fail in one of the
next semiannual tests. Full replacement ensures that all
units will “float” together. One exception might be when
a unit fails in the first year.
Ohmic testing can be a safe, simple, accurate, and reliable
means of determining the state of health of VRLA batteries. It
is important however to understand the following basic guide‐
lines in order to maximize the benefits and avoid possible
misleading test results:
(1) Follow safety regulations: wear eye protection and
remove metal jewelry, and so forth prior to working with
batteries.
(2) Conduct a visual inspection prior to testing. A cracked
case, leaking terminal or post, or bulging battery should
be replaced, not tested.
(3) Temperature changes affect measured ohmic values and
battery capacity. Ohmic measurements should be taken
at 77°F (25°C) ±13°F (7°C).
(4) For maximum accuracy and consistency, batteries should
be tested when in a fully charged state.
(5) Check the battery charging current prior to test. The
charging current should be stable and be within the
normal float current recommendations of the battery
manufacturer for the battery model. If it is not, it is
likely that the batteries have recently been discharged
and a test is not appropriate until this float current
stabilizes.
(6) Whenever possible, ohmic readings should be taken
each time with the same instrument, but as a minimum
with the same model. Changing models will skew the
data and require re-establishing the baseline.
(7) When test equipment is provided with an alert, set the
ohmic baseline and/or thresholds prior to beginning
the test to provide an indication of any deviations from
baseline.
(8) It is essential to take ohmic measurements at the battery
terminal or post. For consistency and accuracy, subse‐
quent tests should always have probes or clamps placed
at the same point while avoiding battery hardware such
as bolt heads or washers. Connecting on the hardware
will influence the readings and could cause replacement
of a healthy battery.
(9) Maintain good contact at the test point for the duration
of the test. If the probe or clamp slips off during the test,
an incorrect reading will result.
(10) For batteries with fully insulated quick disconnect
connectors, the battery should be taken offline by
removing the quick disconnects from the battery termi‐
nals and then measuring and recording the internal
ohmic value of the battery.
(11) Do not condemn a battery based upon results of a single
test without any trending data or an established baseline
for that specific battery.
(12) When one or more units in a battery falls outside the
acceptable range from baseline, replace the entire
string.
(13) A battery tested online can display a different value than
when tested offline due to the charger circuit and load
being across the battery. Always test the same way, either
online or offline, to have consistent and meaningful
results. When ohmic testing is performed online, a
change in current occurs due to the ohmic test set signal
that could impact battery voltage readings. Because
battery float voltage is directly tied to float current, the
sum of the voltages of each battery cell/unit have to
equal the charger float voltage of the battery string. If a
load is applied from the ohmic test set that depresses
one cell/unit, then the others have to rise somewhat to
offset it. As ohmic testing progresses through the battery
string, each cell/unit gets pulled down by the ohmic test
set somewhat, and the charger must boost the string
current to maintain the voltage, raising the voltage of
the cells/units that have not yet been tested. For this
reason, voltage readings should be taken with a voltme‐
ter prior to performing ohmic testing online.
Table 14.4.3.2 Item 9(5).  Battery capacity is determined by
the mass of active material contained in the battery and is a
measure of the battery’s stored energy. The rated capacity of
small VRLA batteries used in fire alarm and signaling system
applications is typically measured in ampere-hours (Ah) where
the ampere-hour rating is based on the battery’s capability to
provide a constant current at the nominal battery voltage for

20 hours. The rated capacity might vary from manufacturer to
manufacturer.
The actual battery capacity during service life, often referred
to as the state of charge (SOC), can vary significantly from rated
capacity due to aging, charge and discharge cycles, tempera‐
ture, and other factors. The unique failure modes of VRLA
batteries due to aging and internal degradation are attributed
for a high failure rate where the actual battery capacity has
degraded to 80 percent of the manufacturer’s rated capacity. As
a result, battery manufacturers often recommend replacement
much sooner than the rated design life for critical systems.
A test of battery capacity is designed to determine if the
battery is capable of continuing to deliver the voltage level
specified by the manufacturer. The results of a capacity test can
also be used to estimate where the battery is in its service life. A
test of capacity is performed by applying a constant current
load to the battery based on the manufacturer’s published
discharge rates until voltage falls to specified levels. Although
discharging the battery for capacity testing concerns some,
VRLA batteries are designed to handle numerous discharges
within the limits established by the battery manufacturer.
The discharge rate selected for testing should be representa‐
tive of the battery duty cycle. At shorter test times, the test dura‐
tion has a greater effect on the capacity calculation. For
example, a 1-minute difference in actual test time for a
5-minute discharge rate compared to a 3-hour discharge rate
will result in a greater deviation of the calculated capacity. The
battery is also operating less efficiently at shorter discharge
rates and the effects of aging and degradation might not be as
prevalent during shorter discharges.
Fire alarm and signaling system loading is typically insuffi‐
cient for the practical application of a battery load test because
the system load cannot be varied to maintain a constant
current equal to the battery manufacturer’s published
discharge rates. The fixed load applied by the system will result
in final voltage levels that are deceptively high. Battery sizing is
also a factor. The calculated system loads for the battery duty
cycle (e.g., 24 hours standby followed by 5 minutes in an
alarm) will rarely align with published discharge rates necessary
for load testing. In many applications where the battery size is
large in comparison to the required system current, the system
loading could be too small to accurately determine battery
capacity. In these cases, a battery near failure could conceivably
satisfy the low discharge rate applied by the fire alarm or signal‐
ing system.
In order to satisfy the load test requirements of Table
14.4.3.2, battery capacity testing can be performed in the
following manner or in accordance with other methods such as
those identified in IEEE Std TM 1188, Recommended Practice for
Maintenance, Testing, and Replacement of Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid
(VRLA) Batteries for Stationary Applications:
(1) Referring to the battery manufacturer’s specifications,
determine the load current for the 3-hour battery rating
to the selected end voltage, typically 1.67 volts per cell
(10.2 volts for a 12-volt system or 20.4 volts for a 24-volt
system).
(2) Record the battery temperature at the negative terminal.
(3) Disconnect the charger and connect a load bank to the
battery terminals.
(4) Apply the constant current specified for the 3-hour rate
to the battery. Once the constant current is applied,
continue the test until the battery terminal voltage
decreases to the specified end voltage.
(5) Stop the test when the selected end voltage is reached.
(6) Record the actual test duration in minutes.
(7) Disconnect the load bank and reconnect the charger.
(8) Calculate percent battery capacity as follows:
% Capacity = [Tactual/(180 × KT)] × 100
where:
Tactual = the test duration in minutes
KT = the temperature correction factor for the actual battery
temperature at the start of the test from Table 14.4.3.2. Addi‐
tional temperature correction factors can be obtained from
IEEE 1188.
(9) Replace the battery if the battery capacity is less than or
equal to 80 percent. Replace the battery at the next scheduled
test interval if the battery capacity is less than 85 percent.
As a good practice, a new battery should be fully charged
and then load tested following the battery manufacturer’s
recommendations prior to installation. A new fully charged
battery should have a capacity of at least 90 percent.
Table 14.4.3.2, Item 17.  Where the manufacturer publishes
limits of accuracy for the operation of an initiating device, the
test method should verify actuation is within the tolerances
provided.
Table 14.4.3.2 Item 22(1) and 22(2).  If, during the course of
the periodic test of audible appliances, it is suspected that
alarm sound levels could be lower than the required minimum,
the system owner or the system owner's designated representa‐
tive should be notified in writing. Such notification will allow
the building owner or designated building representative to
determine whether sound pressure level readings should be
taken for the area(s) in question.
Table 14.4.3.2, Item 24. The extent of testing of a fire alarm
or signaling system, including devices that were not tested,
should be documented in accordance with the test plan in
14.2.10. NFPA 72  does not require testing of an emergency
control function, such as elevator recall, but does require test‐
ing of the emergency control function interface device, such as
the relay powered by the fire alarm or signaling system. Where
the emergency control function is not being tested concurrent
with the fire alarm or signaling system testing, measurement of
the emergency control function interface device output should
be verified using the proper test devices. This might require
reading or observing the condition of a relay, a voltage meas‐
urement, or the use of another type of test instrument. Once
testing is complete, verification that any disabled or disconnec‐
ted interface devices have been restored to normal is essential,
and this verification should be documented in the testing
results.
Testing of the emergency control functions themselves is
outside of the scope of NFPA 72 . A complete end-to-end test
that demonstrates the performance of emergency control func‐
tions actuated by the fire alarm or signaling system might be
required by some other governing laws, codes, or standards, or
the authority having jurisdiction. In that situation, other appli‐
cable installation standards and design documents, not
NFPA 72, would address testing and performance of the emer‐
gency control functions. NFPA 4 provides requirements for
integrated (end-to-end) system testing.

It is important to note that the appropriate NFPA standard
would provide the acceptance criteria for the overall emer‐
gency control function operation requirements, including
performance and test methods, while NFPA 72  covers the
required performance and testing of the emergency function
interface device.
For instance, if an end-to-end test for a building with an
engineered smoke control system is required by some other
governing laws, codes, standards, or the authority having juris‐
diction, the test protocol would have unique criteria for the
smoke control system design, and a special inspector would be
responsible for the overall operation and performance of the
smoke control system in accordance with the appropriate
standard (NFPA 92 and NFPA 101) during the testing, includ‐
ing measuring pressure differentials and ensuring proper fan
and damper operation. Refer to the following extract from
NFPA 101 on smoke control:
9.3.2 System Design. The engineer of record shall clearly
identify the intent of the system, the design method used, the
appropriateness of that method used, and the required means
of inspecting, testing, and maintaining the system. [101: 9.3.2]
9.3.3 Acceptance Testing.  Acceptance testing shall be
performed by a special inspector in accordance with
Section 9.13. [101: 9.3.3]
Even though the fire alarm or signaling system initiating
device might actuate the smoke control system, the actual test‐
ing of the dampers and fan operation would be as required by
the smoke control design and not part of the fire alarm or
signaling system.
Other emergency control operation requirements might be
as follows: For fan shutdown and smoke damper operation, the
fan and damper operations would be in accordance with
NFPA 90A and NFPA 105 respectively, and those equipment
operations would be verified by those responsible for HVAC
systems in combination with the fire alarm system personnel.
Guidance for elevator inspection and testing can be found in
ASME A.17.2, Guide for Inspection of Elevators, Escalators and
Moving Walks. For elevator systems, the recall function, elevator
power shutdown, and hat illumination would be done with the
elevator mechanics present during the test. This operational
test is often accomplished during routine periodic fire alarm
testing. For fire door holder and fire shutter release, it would
be expected that the emergency control function operation of
the doors/shutters would be verified in accordance with
NFPA 80 and NFPA 101 during the test. In some cases, the door
manufacturer representative might need to be present to reset
the equipment.
A.14.4.4   It is suggested that the annual test be conducted in
segments so that all devices are tested annually.
The intent of 14.4.4 is to prevent a test from being made at
intervals exceeding those allowed by Table 14.4.3.2. Annual
tests should be made every 12 months; monthly tests should be
made every 30 days, and so forth. For example, it is not accept‐
able to conduct an annual test in January of year one, and
December of year two (23-month frequency), just because
Table 14.4.3.2 requires a test once each year. See the definition
of frequency in 3.3.121 for minimum and maximum time
between testing events.
N A.14.4.4.1   In addition to safety considerations, other reasons
for delaying fire alarm testing include nationally or regionally
declared disasters, such as pandemics, weather-related emer‐
gencies, or other governmentally recognized disruptions.
A.14.4.4.3   Detectors that cause unwanted alarms should be
tested at their lower listed range (or at 0.5 percent obscuration
if unmarked or unknown). Detectors that actuate at less than
this level should be replaced.
A.14.4.4.6   It is not intended to require testing the pathways at
every device or circuit junctions.
A.14.4.5.3   It is intended that smoke alarms and connected
appliances be considered as a “fire protection system” for the
purpose of applying the responsibility provisions in 14.2.3.
•
N A.14.4.5.4   Permanent occupants (whether renters or owners)
of a dwelling unit should be provided with training and infor‐
mation sufficient to operate, inspect, test, and maintain their
own alarms. The information should cover basic maintenance
requirements, testing, and troubleshooting procedures, and
contact information for further support. It is not intended that
occupants be trained to a level similar to a factory technician or
to qualify them to redesign, program, or extend their alarms
without further training.

Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material. 2019 Edition
N A.14.4.6.3   Permanent occupants (whether renters or owners)
of a dwelling unit should be provided with training and infor‐
mation sufficient to operate, inspect, test, and maintain their
own household alarm system. The information should cover
basic maintenance requirements, testing and troubleshooting
procedures, and contact information for further support. It is
not intended that occupants be trained to a level similar to a
factory technician or to qualify them to redesign, program, or
extend their systems.
N A.14.4.8.1.3   Permanent occupants (whether renters or
owners) of a dwelling unit should be provided with training
and information sufficient to operate, inspect, test, and main‐
tain their own alarm systems. The training should cover basic
maintenance requirements, testing and troubleshooting proce‐
dures, and contact information for further support. It is not
intended that occupants be trained to a level similar to a
factory technician or to qualify them to redesign, program, or
extend their systems.
A.14.4.11   See Annex D, Speech Intelligibility.
A.14.6.1   For final determination of record retention, see
14.4.4.3 for sensitivity options.
A.14.6.1.2   With many software-based fire systems, a copy of
the site-specific software is required to restore system operation
if a catastrophic system failure should occur. Without a back-up
copy readily available on site, recovery of system operation by
authorized service personnel can be substantially delayed.
The intent of this requirement is to provide authorized serv‐
ice personnel with an on-site copy of the site-specific software.
The on-site copy should provide a means to recover the last
installed and tested version of the site-specific operation of the
system. This typically would be an electronic copy of the source
files required to load an external programming device with the
site-specific data. This requirement does not extend to the
system executive software, nor does it require that the external
programmer software if required be stored on site.
It is intended that this copy of the software be an electronic
version stored on a nonrewritable media containing all of the
file(s) or data necessary to restore the system and not just a
printed version of the operation stored on electronic media.
One example of a nonrewritable medium is a CD-R.
A.14.6.2.4   One method used to define the required sequence
of operations and to document the actual sequence of opera‐
tions is an input/output matrix (see Figure A.14.6.2.4).
N A.17.1.1   Examples of initiating devices include, but are not
limited to, fire detection devices, carbon monoxide or other
gas detection devices, devices that detect the operation of fire
suppression and extinguishing systems, waterflow detectors,
pressure switches, manual fire alarm boxes, and other supervi‐
sory signal–initiating devices (including guard tour reporting)
used to ensure timely warning for the purposes of life safety
and the protection of a building, a space, a structure, an area,
or an object.
A.17.1.2   The initiating devices chapter does not specify
requirements for having or using any particular type of initiat‐
ing device for a particular application. The requirements to
have certain initiating devices are found in other NFPA codes
and standards, or in other governing laws, codes, or standards.
In a few instances other parts of this Code might require some
minimal complement of initiating devices. For example, 10.4.5
requires a smoke detector at control unit locations but does
not require complete smoke detection of any particular area.
Similarly, 23.8.5.1.2 requires at least one manual fire alarm box
on any fire alarm system that is connected to a supervising
station and that also employs automatic fire detectors or water‐
flow detection devices. Thus, a system that might be required
solely for the purpose of monitoring a sprinkler system and

sending a signal off premises would still require a smoke detec‐
tor at any control unit locations as well as a single manual pull
station.
A.17.3   Annex B, Engineering Guide for Automatic Fire Detec‐
tor Spacing, provides a detailed design guide for the imple‐
mentation of the performance-based design of fire alarm
systems.
N A.17.4.2.3   Situations exist where supplemental enclosures are
necessary to protect the physical integrity of an initiating
device. Protective enclosures should not interfere with the
performance characteristics of the device. If the enclosure
degrades the performance, methods should be detailed in the
manufacturer's published instructions of the protection device
that clearly identify the degradation. In some cases, adjust‐
ments to initiating device sensitivity or range of operation are
necessary to ensure the objective and performance of the
system.
A.17.4.5   The monitoring of circuit integrity relies on the
interruption of the wiring continuity when the connection to
the initiating device is lost. Terminals and leads, as illustrated
in Figure A.17.4.5(a) and Figure A.17.4.5(b), monitor the pres‐
ence of the device on the initiating device circuit.
A.17.4.6.1   Embossed plastic tape, pencil, ink, or crayon
should not be considered to be a permanently attached plac‐
ard.
A.17.4.7   Some applications that do not require full area
protection do require detection to initiate action when specific
objects or spaces are threatened by smoke or fire, such as at
elevator landings that have ceilings in excess of 15 ft (4.6 m)
and for protection of fire alarm control units. In high-ceiling
areas, to achieve the desired initiation, such as for elevator
recall and protection of fire alarm control units (FACUs),
detection should be placed on the wall above and within 60 in.
(1.52 m) from the top of the elevator door(s) or FACU.
A.17.5.2   This requirement is based on the generally accepted
principle that the ceiling jet is approximately 10 percent of the
distance from the base of the fire to the ceiling. To this figure,
an additional safety factor of 50 percent has been added.
Performance-based methods are available to predict the impact
of partitions on the flow of smoke to detectors and can be used
to substantiate a less restrictive design criterion.
A.17.5.3   The requirement of 17.5.3 recognizes that there are
several different types of detector coverage.

NATIONAL FIRE ALARM AND SIGNALING CODE72-230
2019 Edition Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material.
A.17.5.3.1   The degree of detection coverage is generally a
design issue. Usually the design of detection correlates with the
smoke compartmentation of the building.
Vertical spaces such as stairways and elevator shafts are often
difficult design challenges. For elevator shafts, Section 21.4
provides design criteria to achieve correlation with ASME
A17.1/CSA B44, Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators.
Stairways can be equipped with smoke detection but the
number and location are determined by the design of the stair‐
way.
Generally at least one smoke detector should be located at
the top of the stairway. Additional detectors should be located
on additional floors to achieve design objectives.
A.17.5.3.1.4   Total coverage requires that a fire above the
suspended ceiling be detected. Detector spacing and location
for above ceiling spaces are addressed in 17.7.3.5.2. If that
above-ceiling space is used as an air return plenum, this detec‐
tion can be provided either by smoke detectors placed in
accordance with 17.7.4.2 or where the air leaves the smoke
compartment in accordance with 17.7.5.4.2.2.
A.17.5.3.2   If there are no detectors in the room or area of fire
origin, the fire could exceed the design objectives before being
detected by remotely located detectors. When coverage other
than total coverage is required, partial coverage can be provi‐
ded in common areas and work spaces such as corridors,
lobbies, storage rooms, equipment rooms, and other tenantless
spaces. The intent of selective coverage is to address a specific
hazard only.
Where a specific area is to be protected, all points within
that area should be within 0.7 × the adjusted detector spacing
for spot-type detectors as required by 17.6.3 and 17.7.3.2. Note
that an area does not necessarily mean an entire room. It is
possible to provide properly spaced detectors to provide detec‐
tion for only part of a room. Similarly, the Code permits protec‐
tion of a specific hazard. In that case, detectors within a radius
of 0.7 × the adjusted detector spacing from the hazard provide
the required detection. An example of protection of specific
risk is the smoke detector required by Section 21.3 to be within
21 ft (6.4 m) of an elevator, where elevator recall is required.
It should also be noted that fire detection by itself is not fire
protection. Also, protection goals could be such that detection
being provided for a specific area or hazard might require a
form of total coverage for that particular area or hazard. That
is, it might be necessary to provide detectors above suspended
ceilings or in small closets and other ancillary spaces that are a
part of, or an exposure to, the area or hazard being protected.
A.17.5.3.3   The requirement of 17.5.3.3 recognizes there will
be instances where, for example, a facility owner would want to
apply detection to meet certain performance goals and to
address a particular hazard or need, but that detection is not
required. Once installed, of course, acceptance testing, annual
testing, and ongoing maintenance in accordance with this
Code is expected. The intent of this section is to allow the use
of a single detector, or multiple detectors provided for specific
protection, with spacing to meet specific fire safety objectives as
determined in accordance with 17.6.1.1 and 17.7.1.1.
A.17.6.1.1   The performance objective statement should
describe the purpose of the detector placement and the inten‐
ded response of the fire alarm control unit to the detector acti‐
vation. This statement can include a narrative description of
the required response time of the detectors, a narrative of the
sequence of operations, a tabular list of programming require‐
ments or some other method.
The performance objective of a fire detection system is
usually expressed in terms of time and the size fire the system is
intended to detect, measured in British thermal units per
second (Btu/sec) or kilowatts (kW). Typically, the fire alarm
system designer does not establish this criterion. It is usually
obtained from the design documentation prepared by the
designer responsible for the strategy of the structure as a
whole. Where a prescriptive design is being provided, this
requirement is fulfilled by stating in the design documentation
that the design conforms to the prescriptive provisions of this
Code.
A.17.6.1.3   In a performance-based design environment, the
performance objectives for the fire alarm system are not estab‐
lished by the fire alarm system designer.
A fire protection strategy is developed to achieve those goals.
General performance objectives are developed for the facility.
These general objectives give rise to specific performance
objectives for each fire protection system being employed in
the facility. Consequently, the performance objectives and crite‐
ria for the fire alarm system are part of a much larger strategy
that often relies on other fire protection features, working in
concert with the fire alarm system to attain the overall fire
protection goals for the facility.
In the performance-based design environment, the designer
uses computational models to demonstrate that the spacing
used for automatic fire detectors connected to the fire alarm
system will achieve the objectives established by the system, by
showing that the system meets the performance criteria estab‐
lished for the system in the design documentation. Conse‐
quently, it is imperative that the design objectives and
performance criteria to which the system has been designed
are clearly stated in the system documentation.
A.17.6.1.5   In order to predict the response of a heat detector
using current fire modeling programs and currently published
equations describing plume dynamics, two parameters must be
known: operating temperature and response time index (RTI).
The RTI is the quantification of the rate of heat transfer from
the ceiling jet to the detector sensing element per unit of time,
expressed as a function of ceiling jet temperature, ceiling jet
velocity, and time. Spot-type heat detectors manufactured prior
to July 1, 2008, were not required to be marked with an RTI.
A.17.6.2.3   Detectors should be selected to minimize this
temperature difference in order to minimize response time.
However, a heat detector with a temperature rating that is
somewhat in excess of the highest normally expected ambient
temperature is specified in order to avoid the possibility of
premature operation of the heat detector to non-fire condi‐
tions. Heat-sensing fire detectors of a low temperature classifi‐
cation per Table 17.6.2.1 are intended only for installation in
areas where the ambient temperature is controlled.
A.17.6.3.1.1   Maximum linear spacings on smooth ceilings for
spot-type heat detectors are determined by full-scale fire tests.
[See Figure A.17.6.3.1.1(c).] These tests assume that the detectors
are to be installed in a pattern of one or more squares, each
side of which equals the maximum spacing as determined in
the test, as illustrated in Figure A.17.6.3.1.1(a). The detector to

be tested is placed at a corner of the square so that it is posi‐
tioned at the farthest possible distance from the fire while
remaining within the square. Thus, the distance from the
detector to the fire is always the test spacing multiplied by 0.7
and can be calculated as shown in Table A.17.6.3.1.1.
Figure A.17.6.3.1.1(b) illustrates the smooth ceiling spacing
layout for line-type heat detectors.
Once the correct maximum test distance has been deter‐
mined, it is valid to interchange the positions of the fire and
the detector. The detector is now in the middle of the square,
and the listing specifies that the detector is adequate to detect
a fire that occurs anywhere within that square — even out to
the farthest corner.
In laying out detector installations, designers work in terms
of rectangles, as building areas are generally rectangular in
shape. The pattern of heat spread from a fire source, however,
is not rectangular in shape. On a smooth ceiling, heat spreads
out in all directions in an ever-expanding circle. Thus, the
coverage of a detector is not, in fact, a square, but rather a
circle whose radius is the linear spacing multiplied by 0.7.
This is graphically illustrated in Figure A.17.6.3.1.1(d). With
the detector at the center, by rotating the square, an infinite
number of squares can be laid out, the corners of which create
the plot of a circle whose radius is 0.7 times the listed spacing.
The detector will cover any of these squares and, consequently,
any point within the confines of the circle.
So far this explanation has considered squares and circles. In
practical applications, very few areas turn out to be exactly
square, and circular areas are extremely rare. Designers deal
generally with rectangles of odd dimensions and corners of
rooms or areas formed by wall intercepts, where spacing to one
wall is less than one-half the listed spacing. To simplify the rest
of this explanation, the use of a detector with a listed spacing
of 30 ft × 30 ft (9.1 m × 9.1 m) should be considered. The prin‐
ciples derived are equally applicable to other types.
Figure A.17.6.3.1.1(g) illustrates the derivation of this
concept. In Figure A.17.6.3.1.1(g), a detector is placed in the
center of a circle with a radius of 21 ft (0.7 × 30 ft) [6.4 m
(0.7 × 9.1 m)]. A series of rectangles with one dimension less
than the permitted maximum of 30 ft (9.1 m) is constructed
within the circle. The following conclusions can be drawn:
(1) As the smaller dimension decreases, the longer dimen‐
sion can be increased beyond the linear maximum spac‐
ing of the detector with no loss in detection efficiency.
(2) A single detector covers any area that fits within the
circle. For a rectangle, a single, properly located detector
may be permitted, provided the diagonal of the rectangle
does not exceed the diameter of the circle.
(3) Relative detector efficiency actually is increased, because
the area coverage in square meters is always less than the
900 ft2 (84 m2) permitted if the full 30 ft × 30 ft (9.1 m ×
9.1 m) square were to be utilized. The principle illustra‐
ted here allows equal linear spacing between the detector
and the fire, with no recognition for the effect of reflec‐
tion from walls or partitions, which in narrow rooms or
corridors is of additional benefit. For detectors that are
not centered, the longer dimension should always be
used in laying out the radius of coverage.
Areas so large that they exceed the rectangular dimensions
given in Figure A.17.6.3.1.1(g) require additional detectors.
Often proper placement of detectors can be facilitated by
breaking down the area into multiple rectangles of the dimen‐
sions that fit most appropriately [see Figure A.17.6.3.1.1(e) and
Figure A.17.6.3.1.1(f)] . For example, refer to Figure
A.17.6.3.1.1(h). A corridor 10 ft (3.0 m) wide and up to 82 ft
(25.0 m) long can be covered with two 30 ft (9.1 m) spot-type
detectors. An area 40 ft (12.2 m) wide and up to 74 ft (22.6 m)
long can be covered with four spot-type detectors. Irregular
areas need more careful planning to make certain that no spot
on the ceiling is more than 21 ft (6.4 m) away from a detector.
These points can be determined by striking arcs from the
remote corner. Where any part of the area lies beyond the
circle with a radius of 0.7 times the listed spacings, additional
detectors are required.
Figure A.17.6.3.1.1(h) illustrates smoke or heat detector
spacing layouts in irregular areas.
A.17.6.3.1.3.1   Figure A.17.6.3.1.3.1 illustrates the proper
mounting placement for detectors.
A.17.6.3.2   In addition to the special requirements for heat
detectors that are installed on ceilings with exposed joists,
reduced spacing also could be required due to other structural
characteristics of the protected area, such as possible drafts or
other conditions that could affect detector operation.
See Figure A.17.6.3.2 for an example of reduced spacing for
solid joist construction.

A.17.6.3.5.3   The width of uniform temperature of the plume
when it impinges on the ceiling is approximately 0.4 times the
height above the fire, so reducing spacing below this level will
not increase response time. For example, a detector with a
listed spacing of 15 ft (4.6 m) or 225 ft 2 (21 m 2) need not be
spaced closer than 12 ft (3.7 m) on a 30 ft (9.1 m) ceiling, even
though Table 17.6.3.5.1 states that the spacing should be 0.34 ×
15 ft (0.34 × 4.6 m), which equals 5.1 ft (1.6 m).
A.17.6.3.6   The linear space rating is the maximum allowable
distance between heat detectors. The linear space rating is also
a measure of the heat detector response time to a standard test
fire where tested at the same distance. The higher the rating,
the faster the response time. This Code recognizes only those
heat detectors with ratings of 50 ft (15.2 m) or more.

The performance objective of a fire detection system is
usually expressed in terms of time and the size fire the system is
intended to detect, measured in British thermal units per
second (Btu/sec) or kilowatts (kW). Typically, the fire alarm
system designer does not establish this criterion. It is usually
obtained from the design documentation prepared by the
designer responsible for the strategy of the structure as a
whole. Where a prescriptive design is being provided, this
requirement is fulfilled by stating in the design documentation
that the design conforms to the prescriptive provisions of this
Code.

tions should be determined first. From each of these points of
origin, paths of smoke travel should be determined. Wherever
practicable, actual field tests should be conducted. The most
desired locations for smoke detectors are the common points
of intersection of smoke travel from fire locations throughout
the building.
NOTE: This is one of the reasons that specific spacing is not
assigned to smoke detectors by the testing laboratories.
A.17.7.1.3   In a performance-based design environment, the
performance objectives for the fire alarm system are not estab‐
lished by the fire alarm system designer.
A fire protection strategy is developed to achieve those goals.
General performance objectives are developed for the facility.
These general objectives give rise to specific performance
objectives for each fire protection system being employed in
the facility. Consequently, the performance objectives and crite‐
ria for the fire alarm system are part of a much larger strategy
that often relies on other fire protection features, working in
concert with the fire alarm system to attain the overall fire
protection goals for the facility.
In the performance-based design environment, the designer
uses computational models to demonstrate that the spacing
used for automatic fire detectors connected to the fire alarm
system will achieve the objectives established by the system, by
showing that the system meets the performance criteria estab‐
lished for the system in the design documentation. Conse‐
quently, it is imperative that the design objectives and
performance criteria to which the system has been designed
are clearly stated in the system documentation.
A.17.7.1.8   Product-listing standards include tests for tempo‐
rary excursions beyond normal limits. In addition to tempera‐
ture, humidity, and velocity variations, smoke detectors should
operate reliably under such common environmental conditions
as mechanical vibration, electrical interference, and other envi‐
ronmental influences. Tests for these conditions are also
conducted by the testing laboratories in their listing program.
In those cases in which environmental conditions approach the
limits shown in Table A.17.7.1.8, the detector manufacturer's
published instructions should be consulted for additional infor‐
mation and recommendations.
N A.17.7.1.9   The velocities indicated in individual duct detector
listings are based on applicable standards such as ANSI/
UL 268A, Standard for Smoke Detectors for Duct Application.
A.17.7.1.10   Smoke detectors can be affected by electrical and
mechanical influences and by aerosols and particulate matter
found in protected spaces. The location of detectors should be
such that the influences of aerosols and particulate matter
from sources such as those in Table A.17.7.1.10(a) are mini‐
mized. Similarly, the influences of electrical and mechanical
factors shown in Table A.17.7.1.10(b) should be minimized.
While it might not be possible to isolate environmental factors
totally, an awareness of these factors during system layout and
design favorably affects detector performance.
A.17.7.1.11   Stratification of air in a room can hinder air
containing smoke particles or gaseous combustion products
from reaching ceiling-mounted smoke detectors or fire–gas
detectors.

Stratification occurs when air containing smoke particles or
gaseous combustion products is heated by smoldering or burn‐
ing material and, becoming less dense than the surrounding
cooler air, rises until it reaches a level at which there is no
longer a difference in temperature between it and the
surrounding air.
Stratification also can occur when evaporative coolers are
used, because moisture introduced by these devices can
condense on smoke, causing it to fall toward the floor. There‐
fore, to ensure rapid response, it might be necessary to install
smoke detectors on sidewalls or at locations below the ceiling.
In installations where detection of smoldering or small fires
is desired and where the possibility of stratification exists,
consideration should be given to mounting a portion of the
detectors below the ceiling. In high-ceiling areas, projected
beam–type or air sampling–type detectors at different levels
also should be considered. (See Figure A.17.7.1.11.)
A.17.7.1.12   Construction debris, dust (especially gypsum dust
and the fines resulting from the sanding of drywall joint
compounds), and aerosols can affect the sensitivity of smoke
detectors and, in some instances, cause deleterious effects to
the detector, thereby significantly reducing the expected life of
the detector.
A.17.7.2   Throughout this Code, smoke detector sensitivity is
referred to in terms of the percent obscuration required to

alarm or produce a signal. Smoke detectors are tested using
various smoke sources that have different characteristics (e.g.,
color, particle size, number of particles, particle shape). Unless
otherwise specified, this Code, the manufacturers, and the list‐
ing agencies report and use the percent obscuration produced
using a specific type of gray smoke. Actual detector response
will vary when the characteristics of the smoke reaching the
detector are different from the smoke used in testing and
reporting detector sensitivity.
A.17.7.2.1   The production sensitivity range should only be
used as a benchmark for testing and should not be used as the
sole basis for selection of devices. The percent per foot sensitiv‐
ity marked on the smoke detector is derived from testing in a
smoke chamber, usually referred to as the ANSI/UL 268
Smoke Box. The measurements derived from this measure‐
ment apparatus are only valid in the context of the apparatus
and cannot be used outside the context of the smoke box. The
polychromatic light source employed in the smoke box results
in measurements that are highly dependent upon smoke color
and does not account for variations in light transmission as a
function of wavelength that occurs as fuels and fire ventilation
rates change or as smoke ages. Furthermore, the measurement
apparatus uses a measurement of light obscuration by smoke to
infer a measure of light reflectance when there is no correla‐
tion between these two optical characteristics.
A.17.7.3.1   Except in the case of smoldering, low-energy fires,
all smoke detectors, regardless of the type of technology,
usually rely on the plume and ceiling jet produced by the fire
to transport the smoke upward and across the ceiling to the
detector, sampling port, or projected sensing light beam. Once
sufficient concentration is attained at the detector, sampling
port, or sensing light beam location and, in the case of spot-
type detectors, sufficient flow velocity is attained to overcome
the flow resistance into the sensing chamber, the detector
responds with an alarm signal. Detectors are usually mounted
at the ceiling plane to take advantage of the flow provided by
the plume and the ceiling jet. A hot, energetic fire produces
large plume velocities and temperatures and hot, fast ceiling
jets. This minimizes the time it takes for the smoke to travel to
the detector. A smoldering fire produces little, if any, plume
and no appreciable ceiling jet. Far more time elapses between
ignition and detection under this circumstance.
A.17.7.3.2   In high-ceiling areas, such as atriums, where spot-
type smoke detectors are not accessible for periodic mainte‐
nance and testing, projected beam–type or air sampling–type
detectors should be considered where access can be provided.
A.17.7.3.2.1   Refer to Figure A.17.7.3.2.1 for an example of
proper mounting for detectors. Sidewall detectors mounted
closer to the ceiling will respond faster.
A.17.7.3.2.2   Figure A.17.7.3.2.2 illustrates underfloor mount‐
ing installations.
A.17.7.3.2.3.1   The 30 ft (9.1 m) spacing is a guide for
prescriptive designs. The use of such a spacing is based upon
customary practice in the fire alarm community.
Where there are explicit performance objectives for the
response of the smoke detection system, the performance-
based design methods outlined in Annex B should be used.
For the purposes of this section, “nominal 30 ft (9.1 m)”
should be determined to be 30 ft (9.1 m) ±5 percent [±18 in.
(460 mm)].

A.17.7.3.2.3.1(2)   This is useful in calculating locations in
corridors or irregular areas [see 17.6.3.1.1 and Figure
A.17.6.3.1.1(h)]. For irregularly shaped areas, the spacing
between detectors can be greater than the selected spacing,
provided the maximum spacing from a detector to the farthest
point of a sidewall or corner within its zone of protection is not
greater than 0.7 times the selected spacing (0.7S).
A.17.7.3.2.4   Detectors are placed at reduced spacings at right
angles to joists or beams in an attempt to ensure that detection
time is equivalent to that which would be experienced on a flat

ceiling. It takes longer for the combustion products (smoke or
heat) to travel at right angles to beams or joists because of the
phenomenon wherein a plume from a relatively hot fire with
significant thermal lift tends to fill the pocket between each
beam or joist before moving to the next beam or joist.
Though it is true that this phenomenon might not be signifi‐
cant in a small smoldering fire where there is only enough ther‐
mal lift to cause stratification at the bottom of the joists,
reduced spacing is still recommended to ensure that detection
time is equivalent to that which would exist on a flat ceiling,
even in the case of a hotter type of fire.
A.17.7.3.2.4.2(3)   The geometry and reservoir effect is a signifi‐
cant factor that contributes to the development of velocity,
temperature, and smoke obscuration conditions at smoke
detectors located on the ceiling in beam pocket areas or at the
bottom of beams as smoke collected in the reservoir volume
spills into adjacent pockets. The waffle- or pan-type ceiling
created by beams or solid joists, although retarding the initial
flow of smoke, results in increased optical density, temperature
rise, and gas velocities comparable to unconfined smooth ceil‐
ings.
For waffle- or pan-type ceilings with beams or solid joists, an
alternative smoke detector grid arrangement (such as a shifted
grid), with detectors located to take advantage of the channel‐
ing effect due to the reservoirs created by the beam pockets,
will improve detector response and might allow greater spac‐
ing. See Figure A.17.7.3.2.4.2(3)(a) and Figure
A.17.7.3.2.4.2(3)(b) for an example of shifted grids. The alter‐
native smoke detector grid arrangement and spacing should be
justified by an engineering analysis comparing the alternative
smoke detector grid arrangement with the performance of

smoke detectors on a level ceiling of equal height using 30 ft
(9.1 m) smoke detector spacing.
Figure A.17.7.3.2.4.2(3)(a) illustrates the reservoir and chan‐
neling effect that results from the deep beam configuration.
The strongest gas flows occur in a direction perpendicular to
the beam opposite the fire location. The weaker flow occurs in
a directional 45 degrees off the beam grid; however, the reser‐
voir effect accounts for higher concentrations of smoke eventu‐
ally flowing from the strong area reservoirs into the weak area
reservoirs.
Figure A.17.7.3.2.4.2(3)(b) is a generic example illustrating
how a smoke detection grid using 30 ft (9.1 m) spacing can be
shifted to take advantage of the channeling and reservoir effect
to optimize detection response. In the circle, the fire is split
into four beam bays that must fill with smoke before apprecia‐
ble flows occur into the next adjoining eight beam bays. This
represents the worst case scenario for smoke to reach the
detectors on the circle. The three other fire locations shown
require the fire to initially fill only one or two bays before spill‐
ing to adjacent bays.
A.17.7.3.2.4.2(4)   Corridor geometry is a significant factor that
contributes to the development of velocity, temperature, and
smoke obscuration conditions at smoke detectors located along
a corridor. This is based on the fact that the ceiling jet is
confined or constrained by the nearby walls without opportu‐
nity for entrainment of air. For corridors of approximately 15 ft
(4.6 m) in width and for fires of approximately 100 kW or
greater, modeling has demonstrated that the performance of
smoke detectors in corridors with beams has been shown to be
comparable to spot smoke detector spacing on an unconfined
smooth ceiling surface.
A.17.7.3.2.4.3   A smoke detector should be placed within each
beam channel. Computer modeling has shown that parallel
beams (upslope) are very effective at channeling smoke, and
smoke spillover is rarely detectable in adjacent parallel pockets.
A.17.7.3.2.4.4   Irregular area spacing guidance for level beam
ceilings can be used. Computer modeling has shown that spot-
type detectors should be located on the bottom of perpendicu‐
lar beams.
A.17.7.3.2.4.5   Computer modeling has shown that spot-type
detectors should be located on the bottom of perpendicular
beams and should be aligned with the center of pocket, as
shown, in Figure A.17.7.3.2.4.5.

N A.17.7.3.6.1.1   For an air sampling–-type smoke detector, the
sensitivity at the detector is not equal to sensitivity at the
sampling port. Sampling port sensitivity is dependent on two
main factors:
(1) The number of sampling ports in the piping network
(2) The set alarm sensitivity of the detector
In the absence of performance-based criteria, the sensitivity
at each sampling port of an air sampling-type smoke detector
should not exceed the 4 percent ft obscuration criteria of a
spot-type smoke detector.
N A.17.7.3.6.2.6   Identification can include means such as mark‐
ing or use of a configuration management program that identi‐
fies locations.
N A.17.7.3.6.2.7   A benchmark test point should be provided at
the furthest end of each pipe run, opposite the end of the air
sampling–type smoke detector apparatus. This remote test
point is intended to benchmark system performance at the
time of initial commissioning and during routine test and
inspection. The test point should be labeled to document
benchmark system performance at the time of commissioning,
using manufacturer-supplied labels intended for this purpose.
Benchmark labels should be placed just above test points and
be positioned so that they are visible without obstruction.
N A.17.7.3.6.2.9   Where installed in areas having environmental
conditions such as high temperature or humidity, radiation or
corrosive atmospheres, all pipe network materials should be
suitable for the specific environmental conditions anticipated.
N A.17.7.3.6.3.1   Where the pipe network connects to the detec‐
tor, refer to the manufacturer's published instructions for
implementation of this connection.
N A.17.7.3.6.3.3   Care should be exercised when attaching
clamps to ensure that the pipe is not damaged and to allow for
expansion and contraction of the pipe.
N A.17.7.3.6.4.2   Electrical equipment cabinets are commonly
ventilated vertically (bottom to top passive cooling) or horizon‐
tally (front to back passive cooling) or are fully enclosed with
active internal cooling. For passively cooled applications, the
sampling pipe can be located external to the cabinet with
sampling ports directly in the main airflow of the exhaust vents
or in the cabinet with the sampling port(s) located within 1 in.
to 2 in. (25 mm to 50 mm) of the cabinet top. For fully
enclosed cabinets, the sampling port is located in the cabinet
within 1 in. to 2 in. (25 mm to 50 mm) from the cabinet top. In
either case, the manufacturer’s published installation instruc‐
tions should be followed.
A.17.7.3.7   On smooth ceilings, a spacing of not more than
60 ft (18.3 m) between projected beams and not more than
one-half that spacing between a projected beam and a sidewall
(wall parallel to the beam travel) should be used as a guide.
Other spacing should be determined based on ceiling height,
airflow characteristics, and response requirements.
In some cases, the light beam projector is mounted on one
end wall, with the light beam receiver mounted on the opposite
wall. However, it is also permitted to suspend the projector and
receiver from the ceiling at a distance from the end walls not
exceeding one-quarter the selected spacing ( S). (See Figure
A.17.7.3.7.)
A.17.7.3.7.8   Where the light path of a projected beam–type
detector is abruptly interrupted or obscured, the unit should
not initiate an alarm. It should give a trouble signal after verifi‐
cation of blockage.
A.17.7.4.1   Detectors should not be located in a direct airflow
or closer than 36 in. (910 mm) from an air supply diffuser or
return air opening. Supply or return sources larger than those
commonly found in residential and small commercial establish‐
ments can require greater clearance to smoke detectors. Simi‐
larly, smoke detectors should be located farther away from high
velocity air supplies. See B.4.10.
A.17.7.4.4   Smoke might not be drawn into the duct or
plenums when the ventilating system is shut down. Further‐
more, when the ventilating system is operating, the detector(s)
can be less responsive to a fire condition in the room of fire
origin due to dilution by clean air.
A.17.7.5   Refer to NFPA 101 for the definition of smoke
compartment; NFPA 90A for the definition of duct systems; and
NFPA 92, for the definition of smoke zone.
A.17.7.5.1   Smoke detectors located in an open area(s) should
be used rather than duct-type detectors because of the dilution
effect in air ducts. Active smoke management systems installed
in accordance with NFPA 92 should be controlled by total
coverage open area detection.
A.17.7.5.2   Dilution of smoke-laden air by clean air from other
parts of the building or dilution by outside air intakes can allow
high densities of smoke in a single room with no appreciable
smoke in the air duct at the detector location. Smoke might
not be drawn from open areas if air-conditioning systems or
ventilating systems are shut down.
A.17.7.5.3   Smoke detectors can be applied in order to initiate
control of smoke spread for the following purposes:
(1) Prevention of the recirculation of dangerous quantities of
smoke within a building
(2) Selective operation of equipment to exhaust smoke from
a building
(3) Selective operation of equipment to pressurize smoke
compartments

(4) Operation of doors and dampers to close the openings in
smoke compartments
A.17.7.5.4.2   Smoke detectors are designed to sense the pres‐
ence of particles of combustion, but depending on the sensing
technology and other design factors, different detectors
respond to different types of particles. Detectors based on ioni‐
zation detection technology are most responsive to smaller,
invisible sub-micron sized particles. Detectors based on photo‐
electric technology, by contrast, are most responsive to larger
visible particles.
It is generally accepted that particle size distribution varies
from sub-micron diameter particles predominant in the prox‐
imity of the flame of a flaming fire to particles one or more
orders of magnitude larger, which are characteristic of smoke
from a smoldering fire. The actual particle size distribution
depends on a host of other variables including the fuel and its
physical make-up, the availability of oxygen including air
supply and fire–gas discharge, and other ambient conditions,
especially humidity. Moreover, the particle size distribution is
not constant, but as the fire gases cool, the sub-micron particles
agglomerate and the very large ones precipitate. In other
words, as smoke travels away from the fire source, the particle
size distribution shows a relative decrease in smaller particles.
Water vapor, which is abundantly present in most fires, when
cooled sufficiently will condense to form fog particles — an
effect frequently seen above tall chimneys. Because water
condensation is basically clear in color, when it is mixed with
other smoke particles, it can be expected to lighten the color of
the mixture.
In almost every fire scenario in an air-handling system, the
point of detection will be some distance from the fire source;
therefore, the smoke will be cooler and more visible because of
the growth of sub-micron particles into larger particles due to
agglomeration and recombination. For these reasons, photo‐
electric detection technology has advantages over ionization
detection technology in air duct system applications.
A.17.7.5.4.2.2   Detectors listed for the air velocity present can
be permitted to be installed at the opening where the return
air enters the common return air system. The detectors should
be installed up to 12 in. (300 mm) in front of or behind the
opening and spaced according to the following opening
dimensions [see Figure A.17.7.5.4.2.2(a) through Figure
A.17.7.5.4.2.2(c)]:
(1) Width.
(a) Up to 36 in. (910 mm) — One detector centered in
opening
(b) Up to 72 in. (1.83 m) — Two detectors located at
the one-quarter points of the opening
(c) Over 72 in. (1.83 m) — One additional detector for
each full 24 in. (610 mm) of opening
(2) Depth. The number and spacing of the detector(s) in the
depth (vertical) of the opening should be the same as
those given for the width (horizontal) in
A.17.7.5.4.2.2(1).
(3) Orientation. Detectors should be oriented in the most
favorable position for smoke entry with respect to the
direction of airflow. The path of a projected beam–type
detector across the return air openings should be consid‐
ered equivalent in coverage to a row of individual detec‐
tors.
Additional duct smoke detection is not required where the
air leaves each smoke compartment or in the duct system
before the air enters the return air system in the return air of a
smoke compartment provided with total (complete) smoke
detection compliant with 17.5.3 because the addition of duct
smoke detection would essentially not add any substantial
detection benefit.
A.17.7.5.5.2   Where duct detectors are used to initiate the
operation of smoke dampers, they should be located so that
the detector is between the last inlet or outlet upstream of the
damper and the first inlet or outlet downstream of the damper.

In order to obtain a representative sample, stratification and
dead air space should be avoided. Such conditions could be
caused by return duct openings, sharp turns, or connections, as
well as by long, uninterrupted straight runs.
In return air systems, the requirements of 17.7.5.4.2.2 take
precedence over these considerations. [See Figure
A.17.7.5.5.2(a) and Figure A.17.7.5.5.2(b).]
Usually, it is necessary to manage smoke flow in buildings.
Duct smoke detectors are used to shut down HVAC systems or
initiate smoke management.
Filters have a serious effect on the performance of duct
smoke detectors. The location of the detector relative to the
filter and the source of smoke must be considered during the
design process. Where smoke detectors are installed down‐
stream from filters, they should be deemed to serve the
purpose of providing an alarm indication of the occurrence of
a fire in the HVAC unit (filters, belts, heat exchangers, etc.).
These detectors usually serve the purpose of protecting build‐
ing occupants from the smoke produced by an HVAC unit fire,
or smoke ingress via the fresh air intake for the unit. They
cannot be expected to serve the purpose of providing detection
for the return side of the system.
Where return side detection is required, that requirement
should be fulfilled with separate detectors from those monitor‐
ing the supply side. In order to be effective, return air duct
smoke detectors should be located such that there are no filters
between them and the source of the smoke.
Sampling tubes should be oriented to overcome thermal
stratification due to buoyancy of the smoke in the upper half of
the duct. This condition occurs where duct velocities are low,
buoyancy exceeds flow inertia, or the detector is installed close
to the fire compartment. A vertical orientation of sampling
tubes overcomes the effects of differential buoyancy.
Where a detector is installed on a duct serving a single fire
compartment, where the buoyancy exceeds the flow inertia of
the air in the duct and the sampling tube cannot be oriented
vertically, then the effects of thermal stratification can be mini‐
mized by locating the detector sampling tube in the upper half
of the duct.
The thermal stratification is not a concern where the detec‐
tor is installed far from the fire compartment or where the
smoke is at or close to the average temperature in the duct.

60 in.(1.52 m) or greater, additional detectors might be
required as indicated by an engineering evaluation.
A.17.7.6.1.2   Airflow through holes in the rear of a smoke
detector can interfere with smoke entry to the sensing cham‐
ber. Similarly, air from the conduit system can flow around the
outside edges of the detector and interfere with smoke reach‐
ing the sensing chamber. Additionally, holes in the rear of a
detector provide a means for entry of dust, dirt, and insects,
each of which can adversely affect the detector’s performance.
A.17.7.6.2   For the most effective detection of fire in high-rack
storage areas, detectors should be located on the ceiling above
each aisle and at intermediate levels in the racks. This is neces‐

smoke is achieved by locating the intermediate level detectors
adjacent to alternate pallet sections as shown in Figure
A.17.7.6.2(a) and Figure A.17.7.6.2(b). The detector manufac‐
turer’s published instructions and engineering judgment
should be followed for specific installations.

A.17.8.2   Following are operating principles for two types of
detectors:
(1) Flame Detectors.  Ultraviolet flame detectors typically use a
vacuum photodiode Geiger–Muller tube to detect the
ultraviolet radiation that is produced by a flame. The
photodiode allows a burst of current to flow for each
ultraviolet photon that hits the active area of the tube.
When the number of current bursts per unit time reaches
a predetermined level, the detector initiates an alarm. A
single wavelength infrared flame detector uses one of
several different photocell types to detect the infrared
emissions in a single wavelength band that are produced
by a flame. These detectors generally include provisions
to minimize alarms from commonly occurring infrared
sources such as incandescent lighting or sunlight. An
ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) flame detector senses ultra‐
violet radiation with a vacuum photodiode tube and a
selected wavelength of infrared radiation with a photocell
and uses the combined signal to indicate a fire. These
detectors need exposure to both types of radiation before
an alarm signal can be initiated. A multiple wavelength
infrared (IR/IR) flame detector senses radiation at two or
more narrow bands of wavelengths in the infrared spec‐
trum. These detectors electronically compare the emis‐
sions between the bands and initiate a signal where the
relationship between the two bands indicates a fire.
(2) Spark/Ember Detectors.  A spark/ember-sensing detector
usually uses a solid state photodiode or phototransistor to
sense the radiant energy emitted by embers, typically
between 0.5 microns and 2.0 microns in normally dark
environments. These detectors can be made extremely
sensitive (microwatts), and their response times can be
made very short (microseconds).
A.17.8.2.1   The radiant energy from a flame or spark/ember is
comprised of emissions in various bands of the ultraviolet, visi‐
ble, and infrared portions of the spectrum. The relative quanti‐
ties of radiation emitted in each part of the spectrum are
determined by the fuel chemistry, the temperature, and the
rate of combustion. The detector should be matched to the
characteristics of the fire.
Almost all materials that participate in flaming combustion
emit ultraviolet radiation to some degree during flaming
combustion, whereas only carbon-containing fuels emit signifi‐
cant radiation at the 4.35 micron (carbon dioxide) band used
by many detector types to detect a flame. (See Figure A.17.8.2.1.)
The radiant energy emitted from an ember is determined
primarily by the fuel temperature (Planck’s law emissions) and
the emissivity of the fuel. Radiant energy from an ember is
primarily infrared and, to a lesser degree, visible in wavelength.
In general, embers do not emit ultraviolet energy in significant
quantities (0.1 percent of total emissions) until the ember
achieves temperatures of 3240°F (1727°C or 2000°K). In most
cases, the emissions are included in the band of 0.8 microns to
2.0 microns, corresponding to temperatures of approximately
750°F to 1830°F (398°C to 1000°C).
Most radiant energy detectors have some form of qualifica‐
tion circuitry within them that uses time to help distinguish
between spurious, transient signals and legitimate fire alarms.
These circuits become very important where the anticipated
fire scenario and the ability of the detector to respond to that
anticipated fire are considered. For example, a detector that
uses an integration circuit or a timing circuit to respond to the
flickering light from a fire might not respond well to a defla‐
gration resulting from the ignition of accumulated combustible
vapors and gases, or where the fire is a spark that is traveling up
to 328 ft/sec (100 m/sec) past the detector. Under these
circumstances, a detector that has a high-speed response capa‐
bility is most appropriate. On the other hand, in applications
where the development of the fire is slower, a detector that uses
time for the confirmation of repetitive signals is appropriate.
Consequently, the fire growth rate should be considered in
selecting the detector. The detector performance should be
selected to respond to the anticipated fire.
The radiant emissions are not the only criteria to be consid‐
ered. The medium between the anticipated fire and the detec‐
tor is also very important. Different wavelengths of radiant
energy are absorbed with varying degrees of efficiency by mate‐
rials that are suspended in the air or that accumulate on the
optical surfaces of the detector. Generally, aerosols and surface
deposits reduce the sensitivity of the detector. The detection
technology used should take into account those normally
occurring aerosols and surface deposits to minimize the reduc‐
tion of system response between maintenance intervals. It
should be noted that the smoke evolved from the combustion
of middle and heavy fraction petroleum distillates is highly
absorptive in the ultraviolet end of the spectrum. If using this
type of detection, the system should be designed to minimize
the effect of smoke interference on the response of the detec‐
tion system.
The environment and ambient conditions anticipated in the
area to be protected impact the choice of detector. All detec‐
tors have limitations on the range of ambient temperatures
over which they will respond, consistent with their tested or
approved sensitivities. The designer should make certain that
the detector is compatible with the range of ambient tempera‐
tures anticipated in the area in which it is installed. In addition,
rain, snow, and ice attenuate both ultraviolet and infrared radi‐
ation to varying degrees. Where anticipated, provisions should
be made to protect the detector from accumulations of these
materials on its optical surfaces.
A.17.8.2.2   Normal radiant emissions that are not from a fire
can be present in the hazard area. When selecting a detector
for an area, other potential sources of radiant emissions should
be evaluated. Refer to A.17.8.2.1 for additional information.

A.17.8.3.1.1   All optical detectors respond according to the
following theoretical equation:
S kP
d
e d
=
− ζ
2
where:
S = radiant power reaching the detector
k = proportionality constant for the detector
P = radiant power emitted by the fire
e = Naperian logarithm base (2.7183)
ζ = extinction coefficient of air
d = distance between the fire and the detector
The sensitivity ( S) typically is measured in nanowatts. This
equation yields a family of curves similar to the one shown in
Figure A.17.8.3.1.1.
The curve defines the maximum distance at which the detec‐
tor consistently detects a fire of defined size and fuel. Detectors
should be employed only in the shaded area above the curve.
Under the best of conditions, with no atmospheric absorp‐
tion, the radiant power reaching the detector is reduced by a
factor of 4 if the distance between the detector and the fire is
doubled. For the consumption of the atmospheric extinction,
the exponential term zeta ( ζ) is added to the equation. Zeta is
a measure of the clarity of the air at the wavelength under
consideration. Zeta is affected by humidity, dust, and any other
contaminants in the air that are absorbent at the wavelength in
question. Zeta generally has values between -0.001 and -0.1 for
normal ambient air.

A.17.8.3.2.1   The following are types of application for which
flame detectors are suitable:
(1) High-ceiling, open-spaced buildings such as warehouses
and aircraft hangars
(2) Outdoor or semioutdoor areas where winds or drafts can
prevent smoke from reaching a heat or smoke detector
(3) Areas where rapidly developing flaming fires can occur,
such as aircraft hangars, petrochemical production areas,
storage and transfer areas, natural gas installations, paint
shops, or solvent areas
(4) Areas needing high fire risk machinery or installations,
often coupled with an automatic gas extinguishing system
(5) Environments that are unsuitable for other types of detec‐
tors
Some extraneous sources of radiant emissions that have
been identified as interfering with the stability of flame detec‐
tors include the following:
(1) Sunlight
(2) Lightning
(3) X-rays
(4) Gamma rays
(5) Cosmic rays
(6) Ultraviolet radiation from arc welding
(7) Electromagnetic interference (EMI, RFI)
(8) Hot objects
(9) Artificial lighting
A.17.8.3.2.3   The greater the angular displacement of the fire
from the optical axis of the detector, the larger the fire must
become before it is detected. This phenomenon establishes the
field of view of the detector. Figure A.17.8.3.2.3 shows an exam‐
ple of the effective sensitivity versus angular displacement of a
flame detector.
A.17.8.3.2.4   Virtually all radiant energy–sensing detectors
exhibit some kind of fuel specificity. If burned at uniform rates
[W (J/sec)], different fuels emit different levels of radiant
power in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared portions of the
spectrum. Under free-burn conditions, a fire of given surface
area but of different fuels burns at different rates [W (J/sec)]
and emits varying levels of radiation in each of the major
portions of the spectrum. Most radiant energy detectors
designed to detect flame are qualified on the basis of a defined
fire under specific conditions. If employing these detectors for
fuels other than the defined fire, the designer should make
certain that the appropriate adjustments to the maximum
distance between the detector and the fire are made consistent
with the fuel specificity of the detector.
A.17.8.3.2.6   This requirement has been satisfied by the follow‐
ing means:
(1) Lens clarity monitoring and cleaning where a contamina‐
ted lens signal is rendered
(2) Lens air purge
The need to clean detector windows can be reduced by the
provision of air purge devices. These devices are not foolproof,
however, and are not a replacement for regular inspection and
testing. Radiant energy–sensing detectors should not be placed
in protective housings (e.g., behind glass) to keep them clean,
unless such housings are listed for the purpose. Some optical
materials are absorptive at the wavelengths used by the detec‐
tor.

A.17.8.3.3.1   Spark/ember detectors are installed primarily to
detect sparks and embers that could, if allowed to continue to
burn, precipitate a much larger fire or explosion. Spark/ember
detectors are typically mounted on some form of duct or
conveyor, monitoring the fuel as it passes by. Usually, it is neces‐
sary to enclose the portion of the conveyor where the detectors
are located, as these devices generally require a dark environ‐
ment. Extraneous sources of radiant emissions that have been
identified as interfering with the stability of spark/ember
detectors include the following:
(1) Ambient light
(2) Electromagnetic interference (EMI, RFI)
(3) Electrostatic discharge in the fuel stream
A.17.8.3.3.2   There is a minimum ignition power (watts) for all
combustible dusts. If the spark or ember is incapable of deliver‐
ing that quantity of power to the adjacent combustible material
(dust), an expanding dust fire cannot occur. The minimum
ignition power is determined by the fuel chemistry, fuel parti‐
cle size, fuel concentration in air, and ambient conditions such
as temperature and humidity.
A.17.8.3.3.4   As the distance between the fire and the detector
increases, the radiant power reaching the detector decreases.
Refer to A.17.8.3.1.1 for additional information.
A.17.8.3.3.5   The greater the angular displacement of the fire
from the optical axis of the detector, the larger the fire must
become before it is detected. This phenomenon establishes the
field of view of the detector. Figure A.17.8.3.2.3 shows an exam‐
ple of the effective sensitivity versus angular displacement of a
flame detector.
A.17.8.3.3.6   This requirement has been satisfied by the follow‐
ing means:

cameras and their images for purposes other than flame detec‐
tion. The intent of this paragraph is not to prohibit additional
uses, but to ensure the integrity of the life safety flame detec‐
tion mission of the equipment.

personnel. Component settings include any control or
programming that might affect the operation of coverage of
the detection. This includes, but is not limited to, camera
focus, field of view, motion sensitivity settings, and change of
camera position. Any changes in component settings or ambi‐
ent conditions that affect the design performance of the detec‐
tor should initiate a trouble signal.
A.17.10.2.4   The engineering evaluation should include, but is
not limited to, the following:
(1) Structural features, size, and shape of the rooms and bays
(2) Occupancy and uses of areas
(3) Ceiling heights
(4) Ceiling shape, surface, and obstructions
(5) Ventilation
(6) Ambient environment
(7) Gas characteristics of the gases present
(8) Configuration of the contents in the area to be protected
(9) Response time(s)
A.17.11.2   Examples of such combustion effects are water
vapor, ionized molecules, or other phenomena for which they
are designed. The performance characteristics of the detector
and the area into which it is to be installed should be evaluated
to minimize nuisance alarms or conditions that would interfere
with operation.
N A.17.12.1(1)   Carbon monoxide detectors are located on the
ceiling above permanently installed fuel-burning appliances
because of the buoyancy of the heated combustion gases as
compared to normal ambient temperatures. Detectors should
be located as close as practical to the permanently installed
fuel-burning appliance consistent with considerations of detec‐
tor accessibility, sources of detector contamination, and
nuisance sources. Siting considerations can include transient
backdrafting spillage of flue gases during startup and ventila‐
tion supply or exhaust vents.
N A.17.12.1(2)   The purpose of detectors centrally located on
every habitable level is to detect the migration of carbon
monoxide from permanently installed fuel-burning appliances
and other sources of carbon monoxide. Other sources of
carbon monoxide can include vehicles or other equipment that
uses an internal combustion engine, barbecue grills, propane
operated equipment, and systems used to generate hydrogen.
Detector location and spacing should be based on an engineer‐
ing evaluation that considers potential sources and migration
of carbon monoxide. HVAC systems should be considered in
the locating of carbon monoxide detectors because the HVAC
systems provide a good means of mixing and the migration of
carbon monoxide. Other considerations when locating carbon
monoxide detectors are areas with closed doors and rated
demising walls, which can isolate or separate areas within
HVAC zones. Additional information for the location of carbon
monoxide detectors is available in the Fire Protection Research
Foundation (FPRF) technical report, “Development of a Tech‐
nical Basis for Carbon Monoxide Detector Siting.”

rable so that an alarm is initiated no more than 90 seconds
after a sustained flow of at least 10 gpm (40 L/min).
Features that should be investigated to minimize alarm
response time include the following:
(1) Elimination of trapped air in the sprinkler system piping
(2) Use of an excess pressure pump
(3) Use of pressure drop alarm-initiating devices
(4) A combination thereof
Care should be used when choosing waterflow alarm-
initiating devices for hydraulically calculated looped systems
and those systems using small orifice sprinklers. Such systems
might incorporate a single point flow of significantly less than
10 gpm (40 L/min). In such cases, additional waterflow alarm-
initiating devices or the use of pressure drop-type waterflow
alarm-initiating devices might be necessary.
Care should be used when choosing waterflow alarm-
initiating devices for sprinkler systems that use on–off sprin‐
klers to ensure that an alarm is initiated in the event of a
waterflow condition. On–off sprinklers open at a predeter‐
mined temperature and close when the temperature reaches a
predetermined lower temperature. With certain types of fires,
waterflow might occur in a series of short bursts of a duration
of 10 seconds to 30 seconds each. An alarm-initiating device
with retard might not detect waterflow under these conditions.
An excess pressure system or a system that operates on pressure
drop should be considered to facilitate waterflow detection on
sprinkler systems that use on–off sprinklers.
Excess pressure systems can be used with or without alarm
valves. The following is a description of one type of excess pres‐
sure system with an alarm valve.
An excess pressure system with an alarm valve consists of an
excess pressure pump with pressure switches to control the
operation of the pump. The inlet of the pump is connected to
the supply side of the alarm valve, and the outlet is connected
to the sprinkler system. The pump control pressure switch is of
the differential type, maintaining the sprinkler system pressure
above the main pressure by a constant amount. Another switch
monitors low sprinkler system pressure to initiate a supervisory
signal in the event of a failure of the pump or other malfunc‐
tion. An additional pressure switch can be used to stop pump
operation in the event of a deficiency in water supply. Another
pressure switch is connected to the alarm outlet of the alarm
valve to initiate a waterflow alarm signal when waterflow exists.
This type of system also inherently prevents false alarms due to
water surges. The sprinkler retard chamber should be elimina‐
ted to enhance the detection capability of the system for short
duration flows.
A.17.14   Alarm initiation can be accomplished by devices that
detect the following:
(1) Flow of water in foam systems
(2) Pump activation
(3) Differential pressure
(4) Pressure (e.g., clean agent systems, carbon dioxide
systems, and wet/dry chemical systems)
(5) Mechanical operation of a release mechanism
A.17.15.8   Protective covers, also called pull station protectors
can be installed over manually actuated alarm initiating devices
to provide mechanical protection, environmental protection,
and to reduce the likelihood of accidental or malicious activa‐
tion. The protective covers must be listed to ensure that they
do not hinder the operation of the pull stations and to ensure
that they meet accessibility requirements for activation by
persons with physical disabilities. The Code explicitly permits
installing them over single- or double-action devices. When
installed over a double-action device, the assembly effectively
becomes a triple-action device. Some units include battery-
operated audible warning signals that have been shown to
deter malicious activations. To be effective, it is important that
the regular staff or occupants be aware of the sound and inves‐
tigate immediately in order to catch someone who might other‐
wise actuate the device without cause or to ensure that the
device is actuated if there is a legitimate reason.
A.17.15.9.3   In environments where red paint or red plastic is
not suitable, an alternative material, such as stainless steel,
could be used as long as the box meets the requirements of
17.15.9.2.
A.17.15.9.5   It is not the intent of 17.15.9.5 to require manual
fire alarm boxes to be attached to movable partitions or to
equipment, nor to require the installation of permanent struc‐
tures for mounting purposes only.
N A.17.17.2.2.2   Some dry pipe systems use lower air pressures in
the range of 8 psi to 15 psi (0.5 bar to 1.0 bar), instead of the
traditional 40 psi (2.7 bar). A plus or minus value of 10 psi
(0.7 bar) is not appropriate for these systems and could result
in dry pipe valve actuation prior to transmission of a low air
pressure supervisory signal.
A.18.1   Notification appliances should be sufficient in quantity,
audibility, intelligibility, and visibility so as to reliably convey the
intended information to the intended personnel during an
emergency.
Notification appliances in conventional commercial and
industrial applications should be installed in accordance with
the specific requirements of Sections 18.4 and 18.5.
The Code recognizes that it is not possible to identify
specific criteria sufficient to ensure effective occupant notifica‐
tion in every conceivable application. If the specific criteria of
Sections 18.4 and 18.5 are determined to be inadequate or
inappropriate to provide the performance recommended,
approved alternative approaches or methods are permitted to
be used.
Designers and AHJs are advised to consider alternative
means in occupancies that have individuals with cognitive disa‐
bilities. In addition, persons responsible for evacuation plan‐
ning should consider specific training for individuals with
cognitive disabilities to familiarize them with audible and visual
signals and what responses are necessary based on their capa‐
bilities and any alternative means used.
A.18.1.5   Chapter 18 establishes the means, methods, and
performance requirements of notification appliances and
systems. Chapter 18 does not require the installation of notifi‐
cation appliances or identify where notification signaling is
required. Authorities having jurisdiction, other codes, other
standards, and chapters of this Code require notification signal‐
ing and might specify areas or intended audiences.
For example, Chapter 10 requires audible and visible trouble
signals at specific locations. A building or fire code might
require audible and visual notification throughout all occupia‐
ble areas. In contrast, a building or fire code might require
complete coverage with audible signaling, but might only

require specific areas or spaces to have visual signaling. It is
also possible that a referring code or standard might require
compliance with mounting and notification appliance perform‐
ance requirements without requiring complete notification
signaling system performance. An example might be where an
appliance is specifically located to provide information or noti‐
fication to a person at a specific desk within a larger room.
A.18.3.3.2   The intent is to prohibit labeling that could give an
incorrect message. Wording such as “Emergency” would be
acceptable for labeling because it is generic enough not to
cause confusion. Fire alarm systems are often used as emer‐
gency notification systems, and therefore attention should be
given to this detail.
Combination audible and visual notification appliances are
permitted to have multiple visual elements each labeled differ‐
ently or not labeled at all.
A.18.3.4   Situations exist where supplemental enclosures are
necessary to protect the physical integrity of a notification
appliance. Protective enclosures should not interfere with the
performance characteristics of the appliance. If the enclosure
degrades the performance, methods should be detailed in the
manufacturer's published instructions of the enclosure that
clearly identify the degradation. For example, where the appli‐
ance signal is attenuated, it might be necessary to adjust the
appliance spacings or appliance output.
A.18.3.6   For hardwired appliances, terminals or leads, as
described in 18.3.6, are necessary to ensure that the wire run is
broken and that the individual connections are made to the
leads or other terminals for signaling and power.
A common terminal can be used for connection of incoming
and outgoing wires. However, the design and construction of
the terminal should not permit an uninsulated section of a
single conductor to be looped around the terminal and to
serve as two separate connections. For example, a notched
clamping plate under a single securing screw is acceptable only
if separate conductors of a notification circuit are intended to
be inserted in each notch. [See Figure A.17.4.5(a).]
Another means to monitor the integrity of a connection is to
establish communication between the appliance and the
control unit. The integrity of the connection is verified by the
presence of communication. Monitoring integrity in this fash‐
ion might not require multiple terminals or leads, as previously
described.
It should be noted that monitoring the integrity of the instal‐
lation conductors and their connection to an appliance does
not guarantee the integrity of the appliance or that it is opera‐
tional. Appliances can be damaged and become inoperable or
a circuit can be overloaded, resulting in failure when the appli‐
ances are called upon to work. Presently, only testing can estab‐
lish the integrity of an appliance.
A.18.4.1.1   The Code does not require that all audible notifica‐
tion appliances within a building be of the same type. However,
a mixture of different types of audible notification appliances
within a space is not the desired method. Audible notification
appliances that convey a similar audible signal are preferred.
For example, a space that uses mechanical horns and bells
might not be desirable. A space that is provided with mechani‐
cal horns and electronic horns with similar audible signal
output is preferred.
However, the cost of replacing all existing appliances to
match new appliances can impose substantial economic impact
where other methods can be used to avoid occupant confusion
of signals and signal content. Examples of other methods used
to avoid confusion include, but are not limited to, training of
occupants, signage, consistent use of temporal code signal
pattern, and fire drills.
Hearing protection can attenuate both the ambient noise
level and the audible signal. Specifications from hearing
protection manufacturers might allow the effect of hearing
protection devices to be evaluated. In spaces where hearing
protection is worn due to high ambient noise conditions, visual
notification appliances should be considered.
In addition, where hearing protection is worn due to high
ambient noise conditions, the audible signal and ambient noise
measurements can be analyzed and the audible signal can be
adjusted to account for attenuation caused by the hearing
protection devices.
•
N A.18.4.1.2   The maximum sound pressure level permitted in a
space is 110 dBA. In the 2007 edition, this was reduced from
120 dBA in previous editions. The change from 120 dBA to
110 dBA was made to coordinate with other laws, codes, and
standards.
In addition to the danger of exposure to a high sound level,
long-term exposure to lower levels could also be a problem
when, for example, occupants must traverse long egress paths
to exit or technicians test large systems over extended time
periods.
This Code does not presume to know how long a person will
be exposed to an audible notification system. The limit of
110 dBA has been set as a reasonable upper limit for the
performance of a system. For workers who could be exposed to
high sound levels over the course of a 40-year employment
history, OSHA (Occupational, Health and Safety Administra‐
tion) has established a maximum permitted dose before a hear‐
ing conservation program must be implemented. A worker
exposed to 120 dBA for 7.5 minutes a day for 40 years might be
in danger of suffering a hearing impairment. The OSHA regu‐
lation includes a formula to calculate a dose for situations
where a person is exposed to different sound levels for differ‐
ent periods of time. The maximum permitted by the regulation
is an 8-hour equivalent dose of 90 dBA. It is possible to calcu‐
late the dose a person experiences when traversing an egress
path where the sound pressure level varies as he/she passes
close to, then away from, audible appliances. Table A.18.4.1.2
depicts OSHA permissible noise exposures.
A.18.4.1.3   In determining maximum ambient sound levels,
sound sources that should be considered include air-handling
equipment and background music in a typical office environ‐
ment, office cleaning equipment (vacuum cleaner), noisy chil‐
dren in a school auditorium, car engines in an auto shop,
conveyor belts in a warehouse, and a running shower and fan
in a hotel bathroom. Temporary or abnormal sound sources
that can be excluded would include internal or external
construction activities (i.e., office rearrangements and
construction equipment).
A.18.4.1.5.1   Audibility of a fire or emergency signal might not
be required in all rooms and spaces. For example, a system that
is used for general occupant notification should not require
audibility of the signal in closets and other spaces that are not

considered as occupiable spaces. However, a space of the same
size used as a file room would be considered occupiable and
should have coverage by notification appliances. Also, signaling
intended only for staff or emergency forces might only have to
be effective in very specific locations.
A.18.4.1.5.2   See 3.3.186 for the definition of occupiable.
A.18.4.1.6   Because voice is composed of modulated tones, it is
not valid to compare loudness measurements of tone signals
with loudness measurements of voice signals. A voice signal
that is subjectively judged to be equally as loud as a tone signal
will actually produce a dB reading below that of the tone
signal. The modulated tones of a voice signal can have the
same or greater peak amplitude as that of a tone signal.
However, because they are modulated meters with fast or slow
time, constants will show a lower dB or dBA reading.
A voice signal must have sufficient audibility to result in
intelligible communication. Intelligibility modeling/measure‐
ments (subject based and instrument based) include audibility
as well as many other factors when determining whether a voice
signal is adequate or not adequate.
A.18.4.2.1   Section 10.10 requires that alarm signals be distinc‐
tive in sound from other signals and that this sound not be
used for any other purpose. The use of the distinctive three-
pulse temporal pattern signal required by 18.4.2.1 became
effective July 1, 1996, for new systems installed after that date. It
is not the intent to prohibit continued use of an existing consis‐
tent evacuation signaling scheme, subject to approval by the
authority having jurisdiction. It is also not the intent that the
distinct pattern be applied to visible appliances.
Prior to the 2013 edition, the use of the temporal code 3
distinctive evacuation signal was intended only where evacua‐
tion of the building was the intended response. In order to
eliminate the need for additional signals to mean “relocate,”
the signal is now permitted to be used where relocation or
partial evacuation is the intended response. The simple result
is people should not be in any area where the signal is sound‐
ing and that it is safe to be anywhere that signal is not sound‐
ing.
The temporal pattern can be produced by any audible notifi‐
cation appliance, as illustrated in Figure A.18.4.2.1(a) and
Figure A.18.4.2.1(b).
A.18.4.2.4   Coordination or synchronization of the audible
signal within a notification zone is needed to preserve the

temporal pattern. It is unlikely that the audible signal in one
evacuation/notification zone will be heard in another at a level
that will destroy the temporal pattern. Thus, it would not
normally be necessary to provide coordination or synchroniza‐
tion for an entire system. Caution should be used in spaces
such as atriums, where the sounds produced in one notification
zone can be sufficient to cause confusion regarding the tempo‐
ral pattern.
A.18.4.4   The typical average ambient sound level for the occu‐
pancies specified in Table A.18.4.4 are intended only for design
guidance purposes. The typical average ambient sound levels
specified should not be used in lieu of actual sound level meas‐
urements.
Sound levels can be significantly reduced due to distance
and losses through building elements. Every time the distance
from the source doubles, the sound level decreases by about
6 decibels (dB). Audible notification appliances are typically
rated by manufacturers' and testing agencies at 10 ft (3 m)
from the appliance. Subsequently, at a distance of 20 ft (6.1 m)
from an audible appliance rated at 84 dBA, the sound level
might be reduced to 78 dBA. At a closed door, the loss might
be about 10 dB to 24 dB or more depending on construction.
If the opening around the door is sealed, this might result in a
loss of 22 dB to 34 dB or more.
Δ A.18.4.4.1   Audio levels are commonly measured using units of
decibels, or 1∕10 Bell, abbreviated dB. When measured using a
sound level meter, the operator can select either an A -weigh‐
ted, B-weighted, or C-weighted measurement. The C -weighted
measurement is nominally flat from 70 Hz to 4000 Hz, and the
B-weighted measurement is nominally flat from 300 Hz to
4000 Hz. The A-weighted measurement filters the input signal
to reduce the measurement sensitivity for frequencies to which
the human ear is less sensitive and is relatively flat from 600 Hz
to 7000 Hz. This results in a measurement that is weighted to
simulate the segment of the audio spectrum that provides the
most significant intelligibility components heard by the human
ear. The units used for measurement are still dB, but the short‐
hand for specifying use of the A-weighted filter is typically dBA.
The difference between any two sound levels measured on the
same scale is always expressed in units of dB, not dBA.

The constantly changing nature of pressure waves, which are
detected by ear, can be measured by electronic sound meters,
and the resulting electronic waveforms can be processed and
presented in a number of meaningful ways. Most simple sound
level meters have a fast or slow time constant (125 ms and
1000 ms, respectively) to quickly average a sound signal and
present a root mean square (RMS) level to the meter move‐
ment or display. This is the type of measurement used to deter‐
mine the maximum sound level having a duration of at least
60 seconds. Note that Chapter 14 requires this measurement to
be made using the FAST time setting on the meter. However,
this quick average of impressed sound results in fast move‐
ments of the meter’s output that are best seen when talking
into the microphone; the meter quickly rises and falls with
speech. However, when surveying the ambient sound levels to
establish the increased level at which a notification appliance
will properly function, the sound source needs to be averaged
over a longer period of time. See 3.3.30, Average Ambient
Sound Level. Moderately priced sound level meters have such a
function, usually called Leq or equivalent sound level. For exam‐
ple, an Leq of speech in a quiet room would cause the meter
movement to rise gradually to a peak reading and slowly fall
well after the speech is over. Leq measurements are made over a
specified time period and reported as Leq,t, where t is the time
period. For example, a measurement taken over 24 hours is
reported as Leq24.
Leq readings can be misapplied in situations where the back‐
ground ambient noises vary greatly during a 24-hour period.
Leq measurements should be taken over the period of occu‐
pancy. This is clarified by the definition of average ambient
sound level (see 3.3.30). Note that average in this context is the
integrated average at a particular measurement location, not
the average of several readings taken at different locations. For
example, it would be incorrect to take a reading in a quiet
bathroom and average it with a reading taken near a noisy
machine to get an average to use for the alarm signal design.
The alarm would probably be excessively loud in the quiet
bathroom and not loud enough near the noisy machine.

In areas where the background noise is generated by machi‐
nery and is fairly constant, a frequency analysis can be warran‐
ted. It might be found that the high sound levels are
predominantly in one or two frequency bandwidths — often
lower frequencies. Notification appliances producing sound in
one or two other frequency bandwidths can adequately pene‐
trate the background noise and provide notification. The
system would still be designed to produce or have a sound level
at the particular frequency or frequency bandwidth of at least
15 dB above the average ambient sound level or 5 dB above the
maximum sound level having a duration of at least 60 seconds,
whichever is greater.
In very high noise areas, such as theaters, dance halls, night‐
clubs, and machine shops, sound levels during occupied times
can be 100 dBA and higher. Peak sounds might be 110 dBA or
greater. At other occupied times, the sound level might be
below 50 dBA. A system designed to have a sound level of at
least 15 dB above the average ambient sound level or 5 dB
above the maximum sound level having a duration of at least
60 seconds might result in a required sound pressure level in
excess of the maximum of 115 dBA. A viable option is to
reduce or eliminate the background noise. Professional thea‐
ters or other entertainment venues can have road show connec‐
tion control units (see Section 520.50 of NFPA 70 ) to which
troupes can connect their light and sound systems. These
power sources can be controlled by the system. In less formal
applications, such as many nightclubs, designated power
circuits could be controlled. Diligence needs to be exercised to
ensure that the controlled circuits are used.
Also, in occupancies such as machine shops or other produc‐
tion facilities, care must be exercised in the design to ensure
that the removal of power to the noise source does not create
some other hazard. As with other emergency control functions,
control circuits and relays would be monitored for integrity in
accordance with Chapter 10, Chapter 12, and Chapter 23.
Appropriate audible signaling in high ambient noise areas is
often difficult. Areas such as automotive assembly areas,
machining areas, paint spray areas, and so on, where the ambi‐
ent noise is caused by the manufacturing process itself, require
special consideration. Adding additional audible notification
appliances that merely contribute to the already noisy environ‐
ment might not be appropriate. Other alerting techniques
such as visual notification appliances, for example, could be
more effectively used.
Other codes, standards, laws, or regulations, and the author‐
ity having jurisdiction determine where a signal must be audi‐
ble. This Code section describes the performance requirement
needed for a signal to be considered reliably audible.
A.18.4.5.1   See A.18.4.4.1 for additional information on sound
measurements and weighting scales.
A.18.4.5.2   For example, in critical care patient areas, it is
often desirable to not have an audible notification even at
reduced private mode levels. Each case requires consideration
by the governing authority. Another example would be high
noise work areas where an audible signal needed to overcome
background noise at one time of day would be excessively loud
and potentially dangerous at another time of lower ambient
noise. A sudden increase of more than 30 dB over 0.5 seconds
is considered to cause sudden and potentially dangerous fright.

A.18.4.6.1   See A.18.4.4.1 for additional information on sound
measurements and weighting scales.
A.18.4.6.3   The intent of this section is to require the use of
the low frequency signal in areas intended for sleeping and in
areas that might reasonably be used for sleeping. For example,
this section requires a low frequency audible signal in a
bedroom of an apartment and also in the living room area of
an apartment as it might have sleeping occupants. However, it
would not be required to use the low frequency signal in the
hallways, lobby, and other tenantless spaces. In hotels, the guest
rooms would require use of the low frequency signals, but
other spaces that might require audible signals could use any
listed audible appliances regardless of the frequency content of
the signal being produced. This chapter of the Code addresses
notification appliances connected to and controlled by a fire
alarm or emergency communications system. This chapter does
not address dwelling unit protection such as smoke alarms and
their audible signal characteristics. Requirements for single-
and multiple-station alarms and household fire alarm systems
can be found in Chapter 29.
It is not the intent of this section to preclude devices that
have been demonstrated through peer-reviewed research to
awaken occupants with hearing loss as effectively as those using
the frequency and amplitude specified in this section.
Non-voice (e.g., horns) notification appliances should be
listed as a “low frequency alarm” alarm appliance. Voice appli‐
ances and systems should be capable of 520 Hz ±10 percent
with the appropriate harmonics.
For increased protection in the sleeping area, tactile notifica‐
tion in accordance with Section 18.10 might be an effective
means of awakening those who have normal hearing, as well as
those who are hearing impaired.
A.18.4.6.3(2)   For the purposes of awakening, the low
frequency signal can be produced by a listed stand-alone appli‐
ance or by a listed system consisting of a recorded waveform
delivered through an amplifier and loudspeaker.
A.18.4.7   This subsection permits a more rigorous analysis and
design for audible signaling. Acoustic design practice and
psychoacoustic research have long recognized that for a signal
to be audible, it need only penetrate the background noise in a
one-third or a one octave band. The averaging resulting from
A-weighted analysis and design is a simplification that often
results in systems being overdesigned. This overdesign is not
dangerous but can be costly and is certainly not needed for
effective system performance.
A.18.4.7.2   Noise at a lower frequency can mask a signal at an
adjacent higher frequency. Thus, it is necessary to calculate the
effective masked level of the noise in accordance with estab‐
lished procedures. Figure A.18.4.7.2 shows an example of an
octave band analysis of noise along with the calculated effective
masked threshold and the proposed alarm signal.
A.18.4.8.1   The sound content of directional sounders is very
different from that of the traditional fire alarm audible notifi‐
cation appliances. Traditional fire alarm audible notification
appliances have a strong tonal content, usually centered near
the 3 kHz region. Directional sounders use broadband
frequency content, usually covering most of the human audible
frequency range, 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Figure A.18.4.8.1(a)
compares the frequency content of a traditional fire alarm
audible notification appliance to a directional sounder. This
figure shows that while the fire alarm audible notification appli‐
ance clearly dominates the 3 kHz and upper harmonics, the
broadband content of the directional sounder is 20 dB to
30 dB in other frequency bands or ranges. The fire alarm has
an overall A-weighted sound level greater than the directional
sounder and will be perceived as being louder. However, since
the directional sounder has a wide spectral range, the signal
penetrates the fire alarm signal in several other frequency
bands as permitted by 18.4.7.

There are three main types of information that allow the
brain to identify the location of a sound. The first two are
known as binaural cues because they make use of the fact that
we have two ears, separated by the width of our head. A sound
that emanates from either side of the mid-line will arrive first at
the ear closer to it and will be loudest at the ear closer to it. At
low frequencies the brain recognizes differences in the arrival
time of sound between the ears (interaural time differences).
At higher frequencies the salient signal is the loudness/inten‐
sity difference between the sounds at each ear (interaural
intensity differences). Refer to Figure A.18.4.8.1(b). For single
frequencies, these cues are spatially ambiguous.
The inherent ambiguity has been described as the “cone of
confusion.” This arises from the fact that for any given
frequency there are numerous spatial positions that generate
identical timing/intensity differences. These can be graphically
represented in the form of a cone, the apex of which is at the
level of the external ear. The cone of confusion is the main
reason for our not being able to localize pure tones.
The final piece of sound localization information processed
by the brain is the head-related transfer function (HRTF). The
HRTF refers to the effect the external ear has on sound. As a
result of passing over the bumps or convolutions of the pinna,
the sound is modified so that some frequencies are attenuated
and others are amplified. Refer to Figure A.18.4.8.1(c).
Although there are certain generalities in the way the pinnae
modify sound, the HRTF is unique to each individual. The role
of the HRTF is particularly important when determining
whether a sound is in front of or behind us. In this instance the
timing and intensity differences are negligible, and there is
consequently very little information available to the central
nervous system on which to base this decision. To locate the
direction of a sound source, the larger the frequency content
to overcome the ambiguities inherent to single tones, the
better the accuracy.
A.18.4.8.2   ITD: A difference in arrival times of waveform
features (such as peaks and positive-going zero crossings) at the
two ears is known as the interaural time difference, or ITD.
The binaural physiology is capable of using phase information
from ITD cues only at low frequencies below about 1500 Hz.
However, the binaural system can successfully register an ITD
that occurs at a high frequency such as 4000 Hz if the signal is

modulated. The modulation, in turn, must have a rate that is
less than about 1000 Hz.
ILD: Comparison between intensities in the left and right
ears is known as the interaural level difference, or ILD. ILD
cues exist physically only for frequencies above about 500 Hz.
They become large and reliable for frequencies above 3000 Hz,
making ILD cues most effective at high frequencies.
ATF: The anatomical transfer function (ATF), also known as
the head-related transfer function (HRTF), is used by listeners
to resolve front–back confusion and to determine elevation.
Waves that come from behind tend to be boosted in the
1000 Hz frequency region, whereas waves that come from the
forward direction are boosted near 3000 Hz. The most
dramatic effects occur above 4000 Hz.
These localization cues can be implemented simultaneously
when the source signal is a broadband sound containing a
range of low to high frequencies. For example, octave bands of
1 kHz (707–1414 Hz) for ITD, 4 kHz (2828–5856 Hz) for ILD,
and 8 kHz (5657–11,314 Hz) for ATF would fall within the
effective frequency ranges required in 18.4.7.
Additional information on sound localization and auditory
localization cues is contained in the following article: http://
www.aip.org/pt/nov99/locsound.html, I.1.2.16.1.
The ability to pinpoint the location of a sound source is
based on the physics of sound and the physiology of the human
hearing mechanism. The brain processes a large amount of
neural signals, some of which provide cues to the sound sour‐
ce's location. People are able to hear sound ranging from
about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Unfortunately, pure tones in this
frequency range provide only limited localization information.

The primary localization cues are provided by interaural time
differences (ITDs) (lower frequencies), interaural intensity
differences (IIDs) (mid to higher frequencies), and the head-
related transfer function (HRTF) (higher frequencies). In
enclosed spaces that can be somewhat reverberant, the prece‐
dence effect (PE) also provides directional information.
The interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural inten‐
sity difference (IID) are termed binaural cues because they
depend on both ears separated by the width of the head. At
lower frequencies (longer wavelength), the time delay between
arriving sound signals is detectable. ITD is most evident in
frequencies below about 500 Hz with clicks or short bursts of
sound. At higher frequencies (shorter wavelength), the loud‐
ness/intensity differences between the ears is more noticeable
because of partial shielding of the more distant ear by the
head. IID is most evident for frequencies above 3000 Hz.
The head-related transfer function (HRTF) relies on the
effect of the external ear on perceived sound. The HRTF
describes the transforming effect of the head, torso, and exter‐
nal ear on sound as it travels from the sound source to the ear
canals. The HRTF changes depending on sound source loca‐
tion, providing an additional localization cue. HRTF operates
over a range of frequencies but seems to be most effective in
the 5000 Hz to 10,000 Hz range. Combined with the listener's
head motion, HRTF provides an independent localization
method to complement ITD and IID capabilities.
The precedence effect (PE) is important for discriminating
between the direct sound signal and reflected sound, a
common situation within buildings. The ear is capable of
discerning and fixating on the first sound received (line-of-
sight direct signal) and disregarding later signals (reflected
sound). The acoustical signal arriving first at the ears
suppresses the ability to hear other signals (including reverber‐
ation) that arrive up to about 40 milliseconds after the initial
signal.
All of the preceding cues are utilized simultaneously when
the source signal is broadband sound containing a range of low
and high frequencies, and when the sound arrives in bursts
rather than as steady state sound. The combination of different
cues provides reinforcement and redundancy of information to
enhance the ability to locate the sound source. Broadband
sound tends to eliminate potential ambiguities that occur for
pure tone or narrowband sound sources.
Other types of sound patterns can be used as directional
sounders that can be used for audible exit marking. Some
scientific research has been performed to develop a directional
sounder that utilizes a tonal sound different from the example
above. As with the directional sound example presented above,
the development of this alternative signal is similarly rooted in
the vast research data that exists for sound localization and
directional auditory cues.
An example of an alternative directional sound signal can be
a sequence of two harmonic two-tone complexes. This
sequence starts with a complex of low fundamental frequencies
of 262 and 330 Hz having duration of 200 ms. This sound is
then followed by a 200-ms silence. Next the sequence continues
with a second sound that is a complex of low fundamental
frequencies of 330 and 392 Hz having a duration of 200 ms.
After another 200-ms silence, this whole pattern is repeated.
Localizability was ensured by the dense harmonic structure
of the signal, with closely spaced harmonics up to 20 kHz. In
addition sharp signal onsets were included to aid the detection
of interaural time differences, thus increasing localizability.
A.18.4.8.5   Where directional sounders are used, they should
not be located on only a single exit. They should be located at
all of the identified exits in the building. This is to ensure that
in an evacuation or relocation the occupants utilize all of the
exits and areas of refuge, not just those that have directional
sounders located near them. Some examples of exits would
include the following:

A.18.4.11.4   ADS assignments should be a part of the original
design process. See the discussion in A.3.3.6. The design draw‐
ings should be used to plan and show the limits of each ADS
where there is more than one.
All areas that are intended to have audible occupant notifi‐
cation, whether by tone only or by voice should be designated
as one or more ADSs. Drawings or a table listing all ADSs
should be used to indicate which ADSs will require intelligible
voice communications and those that will not. The same draw‐
ings or table could be used to list audibility requirements
where tones are used and to list any forms of visual or other
notification or communications methods being employed in
the ADS.
A.18.5   The mounting height of the appliances affects the
distribution pattern and level of illumination produced by an
appliance on adjacent surfaces. It is this pattern, or effect, that
provides occupant notification by visual appliances. If mounted
too high, the pattern is larger but at a lower level of illumina‐
tion (measured in lumens per square foot or foot-candles). If
mounted too low, the illumination is greater (brighter) but the
pattern is smaller and might not overlap correctly with that of
adjacent appliances.
A qualified designer could choose to present calculations to
an authority having jurisdiction showing that it is possible to
use a mounting height greater than 96 in. (2.44 m) or less than
80 in. (2.03 m), provided that an equivalent level of illumina‐
tion is achieved on the adjacent surfaces. This can be accom‐
plished by using listed higher intensity appliances or closer
spacing, or both.
Engineering calculations should be prepared by qualified
persons and should be submitted to the authority having juris‐
diction, showing how the proposed variation achieves the same
or greater level of illumination provided by the prescriptive
requirements of Section 18.5.
The calculations require knowledge of calculation methods
for high-intensity visual notification appliances. In addition, the
calculations require knowledge of the test standards used to
evaluate and list the appliance.
A.18.5.1   There are two methods of visual signaling. These are
methods in which notification of an emergency condition is
conveyed by direct viewing of the illuminating appliance or by
means of illumination of the surrounding area.
Visual notification appliances used in the public mode must
be located and must be of a type, size, intensity, and number so
that the operating effect of the appliance is seen by the inten‐
ded viewers regardless of the viewer’s orientation.
A.18.5.1.2   Visual notification appliances for fire or emergency
signaling might not be required in all rooms or spaces. For
example, a system that is used for general occupant notification
should not require visual signaling in closets and other spaces
that are not considered as occupiable areas. However, a space
of the same size used as a file room could be considered occu‐
piable and should have coverage by notification appliances.
Also, signaling intended only for staff or emergency forces
might only have to be effective in very specific locations.
A.18.5.2.2   Occupant notification by visual signaling is not
required by NFPA 72 except in high noise areas (see 18.4.1.1).
Just as with audible occupant notification, the requirement to
have such signaling originates from other governing laws,
codes, or standards. Those other governing laws, codes, or
standards specify the areas or spaces that require either audi‐
ble, visual, or both types of occupant notification. NFPA 72
then provides the standards for those systems.
•
N A.18.5.3.3   Research indicates that equivalent indirect alerting
is obtained between 0.1 milliseconds to 20 milliseconds. Testing
above 20 milliseconds indicates that the effective candela must
be increased to obtain equivalent alerting capability to that of
shorter light pulse durations of 20 milliseconds or less. The
effective candela rating should be increased by the value in
Table A.18.5.3.3 to achieve equivalent alerting capability.

NATIONAL FIRE ALARM AND SIGNALING CODE72-254
2019 Edition Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material.
A.18.5.3.5   Effective intensity is the conventional method of
equating the brightness of a flashing light to that of a steady-
burning light as seen by a human observer. The units of effec‐
tive intensity are expressed in candelas (or candlepower, which
is equivalent to candelas). For example, a flashing light that has
an effective intensity of 15 cd has the same apparent brightness
to an observer as a 15 cd steady-burning light source.
Measurement of effective intensity is usually done in a labo‐
ratory using specialized photometric equipment. Accurate field
measurement of effective intensity is not practical. Other units
of measure for the intensity of flashing lights, such as peak
candela or flash energy, do not correlate directly to effective
intensity and are not used in this Code.
Visual notification appliances might be used to signal fire or
other emergencies and might be intended to initiate evacua‐
tion, relocation, or some other behavior. Lights intended to
initiate evacuation due to fire are required by the Code to be
clear or white. Colored lights, such as amber/yellow lights,
might be used in a combination system for any emergency
(fire, bomb, chemical, weather, etc.) when the intent is for the
signal recipient to seek additional information from other sour‐
ces (voice, text displays, and so on).
Example Scenario 1: A building has a fire alarm system used
for general evacuation. A separate mass notification system is
used to provide voice instructions and information in the event
of non-fire emergencies. The fire alarm system would have
white/clear visual notification appliances intended to alert
occupants of the need to evacuate. The mass notification
system would have amber/yellow visual notification appliances
that are intended to signal the need to get additional informa‐
tion from either audible voice announcements, text or graphi‐
cal displays, or other information sources controlled or
operated from the mass notification system. In the event that
both systems are activated at the same time, the visual notifica‐
tion appliances should be synchronized per 18.5.5.5.2.
Example Scenario 2: A building has a mass notification
system that provides information and instructions for a variety
of emergency situations, including fire. Fire alarm initiation
might be by a stand-alone fire detection system or might be an
integral part of the mass notification system. In the event of an
emergency, textual audible appliances are used to provide
information. Visual signaling could be accomplished using one
set of clear or colored visual notification appliances to indicate
the need to get additional information. Visual textual informa‐
tion can be provided by text or graphic display or other visual
information appliances. The content of the audible and visual
messages will vary depending on the emergency.
A.18.5.3.7   It is not the intent to establish viewing and synchro‐
nization requirements for viewing locations outdoors. As an
example, there is no need for Floor No. 1 to be synchronized
with Floor No. 2 if there is no visual coupling as in an atrium.
Studies have shown that the effect of visual notification
appliances on photosensitive epilepsy lessens with distance and
viewing angle.
As long as the composite flash rate is no greater than that
produced by two listed visual notification appliances as allowed
by 18.5.5.5.2, compliance is achieved.
Example: A ballroom has multiple synchronized visual notifi‐
cation appliances operating during an emergency, the doors
exiting the ballroom are opened, and the visual notification
appliances outside in the lobby and corridor are also operating.
The visual notification appliances in the corridor and lobby are
synchronized with each other, but the visual notification appli‐
ances outside the ballroom are not synchronized with the visual
notification appliances inside the ballroom. This would be an
acceptable application because the composite flash rate does
not exceed that allowed by 18.5.5.5.2.
A.18.5.4   The prescriptive requirements of Section 18.5 assume
the use of appliances having very specific characteristics of light
color, intensity, distribution, and so on. The appliance and
application requirements are based on extensive research.
However, the research was limited to typical residential and
commercial applications such as school classrooms, offices,
hallways, and hotel rooms. While these specific appliances and
applications will likely work in other spaces, their use might not
be the most effective solution and might not be as reliable as
other visual notification methods.
For example, in large warehouse spaces and large distribu‐
tion spaces such as super stores, it is possible to provide visual
signaling using the appliances and applications of this chapter.
However, mounting visual notification appliances at a height of
80 in. to 96 in. (2.03 m to 2.44 m) along aisles with rack storage
subjects the visual notification appliances to frequent mechani‐
cal damage by forklift trucks and stock. Also, the number of
appliances required would be very high. It might be possible to
use other appliances and applications not specifically
addressed by this chapter at this time. Alternative applications
must be carefully engineered for reliability and function and
would require permission of the authority having jurisdiction.
Tests of a system in large warehouse/super stores designed
using the prescriptive approach of 18.5.5.5 showed that high
ambient light levels resulted in both indirect and direct signal‐
ing effects. The signal-to-noise ratio produced by the operating
visual notification appliances was low in many locations.
However, with visual notification appliances located over the
aisles or unobstructed by stock, indirect and some direct notifi‐
cation was sometimes achieved. Direct notification occurs even
when occupants do not look up toward the ceiling-mounted
visual notification appliances due to the extended cone of
vision shown in Figure A.18.5.4(a). The visual notification
appliance intensity and spacing resulting from the prescriptive
design was generally sufficient for occupant notification by a
combination of direct and indirect signaling. Testing showed
that the best performance was achieved where visual notifica‐
tion appliances were directly over aisles or where visual notifica‐
tion appliances in adjacent aisles were not obstructed by stock.
The performance-based design method will almost always
result in aisles not having a line of visual notification appliances
in them, because the spacing of visual notification appliances
can be greater than the spacing of aisles. Also, it is recognized
that aisles might be relocated after installation of the system.
Good design practice is to place visual notification appliances
over aisles, especially those that are likely to remain unchanged
such as main aisles, and over checkout areas. Where reorgani‐
zation of aisles results in visual notification appliances not in or
over an aisle, or where that is the base design, it is important to
have a clear view from that aisle to a nearby visual notification
appliance. See Figure A.18.5.4(b). Some spaces might have
marginal visual notification appliance effect (direct or indi‐
rect). However, occupants in these large stores and storage
occupancies move frequently and place themselves in a posi‐
tion where they receive notification via the visual notification
appliances. In addition, complete synchronization of the visual

 notification appliances in the space produced a desirable
effect.
Visual notification using the methods contained in 18.5.5.5
is achieved by indirect signaling. This means the viewer need
not actually see the appliance, just the effect of the appliance.
This can be achieved by producing minimum illumination on
surfaces near the appliance, such as the floor, walls, and desks.
There must be a sufficient change in illumination to be notice‐
able. The tables and charts in Section 18.5 specify a certain
candela-effective light intensity for certain size spaces. The data
were based on extensive research and testing. Appliances do
not typically produce the same light intensity when measured
off-axis. To ensure that the appliance produces the desired illu‐
mination (effect), it must have some distribution of light inten‐
sity to the areas surrounding the appliance. ANSI/UL 1971,
Standard for Signaling Devices for the Hearing Impaired , specifies
the distribution of light shown to provide effective notification
by indirect visual signaling.
A.18.5.5.1   The requirements for the location of appliances
within a building or structure are intended to apply to visual
notification appliances applied in accordance with 18.5.5.5,
18.5.5.6, and 18.5.5.8. The mounting and location of applian‐
ces installed using the performance-based alternative of
18.5.5.7 can be located differently, provided they meet the
intended performance requirements. Other appliances, such
as graphic displays, video screens, and so on, should be located
so that they meet their intended performance.
Where low ceiling heights or other conditions do not permit
mounting at a minimum of 80 in. (2.03 m), visual notification
appliances can be mounted at a lower height. However, lower‐
ing the mounting height reduces the area of coverage for that
visual notification appliance. The performance-based methods
of 18.5.5.7 can be used to determine the area of coverage.
Visual notification appliance mounting height should not be
lowered below the plane of normal human viewing [approxi‐
mately 5 ft (1.5 m)] except where ceiling heights limit the
mounting position.
The mounting height requirement of 80 in. to 96 in. (2.03 m
to 2.44 m) does not address the possibility of conditions where
ceiling heights are less than 80 in. (2.03 m). The range that is
permitted [80 in. to 96 in. (2.03 m to 2.44 m)] ensures that
visual notification appliances are not mounted too high, which
would result in lower levels of illumination on surrounding
walls and on the floor. The lower limit of the range ensures
that a minimum percentage of the surrounding surfaces is illu‐
minated and that the top of the illuminated pattern is at or
above the plane of normal human viewing [approximately 5 ft
(1.5 m)]. Wall mounting of visual notification appliances ,
which are listed only for wall mounting, can result in little or
no illumination above the plane of the visual notification appli‐
ance. In the case of lower ceiling heights and mounting close
to the ceiling, the level of illumination on the floor and
surrounding walls is not reduced but the walls have a near
100 percent illuminated or “painted” area because the visual
notification appliance is close to the ceiling. That is, there is
little or no wall surface above the plane of the visual notifica‐
tion appliance that is not illuminated when the visual notifica‐
tion appliance is mounted close to the ceiling. Thus, when a
visual notification appliance is mounted lower than the mini‐
mum [80 in. (2.03 m)] but still close to the ceiling, the only

loss of signal is the smaller pattern produced on the horizontal
plane (floor).
In the case where the only change is a lower mounting
height due to a lower ceiling height, the room size covered by a
visual notification appliance of a given value should be reduced
by twice the difference between the minimum mounting height
of 80 in. (2.03 m) and the actual, lower mounting height. For
example, if a 15 cd effective visual notification appliance that
normally covers a 20 ft (6.1 m) square space is being used and
the height of the space is 63 in. (1.6 m) and the visual notifica‐
tion appliance is mounted at 59 in. (1.5 m), the visual notifica‐
tion appliance can only cover a 16.5 ft ( 5.0 m) square space:
20 ft −2 (80 in. − 59 in.) (1 ft/12 in.) = 16.5 ft (5.0 m).
The room size reduction assumes that the horizontal pattern
on each side of the visual notification appliance is reduced by
the same amount that the visual notification appliance height is
reduced.
A.18.5.5.4   Visual notification appliances must be listed for
either wall mounting or ceiling mounting. The effectiveness of
ceiling-mounted appliances does not depend on them being
mounted on a surface. Therefore, the Code permits them to be
suspended below the ceiling using proper electrical installation
methods. Appliances mounted parallel to the floor, whether on
a ceiling or suspended, can sometimes significantly reduce
installation costs and provide better coverage.
In convention spaces and areas with racking and shelving,
wall-mounted appliances are frequently obstructed or subjected
to mechanical damage. Ceiling mounting (or suspending) the
appliances can prevent problems and increases the ability for
the appliance to cover the floor area through direct and indi‐
rect signaling. See A.18.5.4.
A.18.5.5.5   The visual notification appliance  intensities listed
in Table 18.5.5.5.1(a) or Table 18.5.5.5.1(b), 18.5.5.6, or Table
18.5.5.8.3 or determined in accordance with the performance
requirements of 18.5.5.7 are the minimum required intensities.
It is acceptable to use a higher intensity visual notification
appliance in lieu of the minimum required intensity.
Areas large enough to exceed the rectangular dimensions
given in Figure A.18.5.5.5(a) through Figure A.18.5.5.5(c)
require additional appliances. Often, proper placement of
appliances can be facilitated by breaking down the area into
multiple squares and dimensions that fit most appropriately [see
Figure A.18.5.5.5(a) through Figure A.18.5.5.5(d)] . An area that is
40 ft (12.2 m) wide and 80 ft (24.4 m) long can be covered with
two 60 cd appliances. Irregular areas and areas with dividers or
partitions need more careful planning to make certain that at
least one 15 cd appliance is installed for each 20 ft × 20 ft
(6.1 m × 6.1 m) area and that light from the appliance is not
blocked.
N A.18.5.5.5.1   In rooms with an average ambient level greater
than 500 lx, visual notification appliance spacing should be
reduced by 30 percent (i.e., listed spacing × 0.7) or the
required effective candela should be increased by 100 percent
(i.e., effective candela × 2.0).
Ambient light levels have an effect on the proper candela
ratings in indirect viewing of visual notification appliances. The
amount of ambient light is normally from two sources: artificial
lighting and natural light from outside.
In rooms or areas requiring artificial illumination, the ambi‐
ent lux value for selecting candela values should be based on
the maximum light intensity that the artificial light sources
provide.
In rooms or areas that have natural outside light, the ambi‐
ent lux value should be that of the maximum light level with
the shades or curtains fully open during daylight hours and
with the artificial lighting illuminated.
Ambient light can be measured using a calibrated light
meter in the approximate center of the room, 4 ft (1.2 m)
above the floor, with the sensor facing upward. The light meter
should measure light level from 0 to 10,000 lx with a precision
accuracy of ±5 percent.
For design purposes, typical ambient illumination for various
locations and activities are shown in Table A.18.5.5.5.1 and can
be used as a guide for the selection of appropriate visual signal
intensity.
A.18.5.5.5.2(2)   The field of view is based on the focusing capa‐
bility of the human eye specified as 120 degrees in the Illumi‐
nating Engineering Society (IES) Lighting Handbook Reference and
Application. The apex of this angle is the viewer’s eye. In order
to ensure compliance with the requirements of 18.5.5.5.2, this
angle should be increased to approximately 135 degrees.

Testing has shown that high flash rates of high-intensity
visual notification appliances can pose a potential risk of seiz‐
ure to people with photosensitive epilepsy. To reduce this risk,
more than two visual notification appliances are not permitted
in any field of view unless their flashes are synchronized. This
does not preclude synchronization of appliances that are not
within the same field of view.
A.18.5.5.5.6   This subsection is also intended to permit ceiling-
mounted visual notification appliances to be suspended below
the ceiling, provided the visual notification appliance height is
not below the viewing plane for any ceiling height.
A.18.5.5.6   Because the occupants are usually alert and
moving, and because their vision is focused by the narrowness
of the space, corridor signaling is permitted to be by direct

Δ A.18.5.5.7   A design that delivers a minimum illumination of
0.0375 lumens/ft2 (footcandles) [ 0.4036 lumens/m2 (lux)] to
all occupiable spaces where visual notification is required is
considered to meet the minimum light intensity requirements
of 18.5.5.5.2(1). This level of illumination has been shown to
alert people by indirect viewing (reflected light) in a large vari‐
ety of rooms with a wide range of ambient lighting conditions.
The illumination from a visual notification appliance at a
particular distance is equal to the effective intensity of the
appliance divided by the distance squared (the inverse square
law). Table 18.5.5.5.1(a) and Table 18.5.5.5.1(b) are based on
applying the inverse square law to provide an illumination of at
least 0.0375 lumens/ft 2 (0.4037 lumens/m 2) throughout each
room size. For example, a 60 cd effective intensity appliance in
a 40 ft × 40 ft (12.2 m × 12.2 m) room produces
0.0375 lumens/ft 2 (0.4037 lumens/m 2) on the opposite wall
40 ft (12.2 m) away [60 ÷ (40 ft) 2 or (60 ÷ (12.2 m) 2)]. This
same 60 cd effective intensity appliance produces 0.0375
lumens/ft2 (0.4037 lumens/m 2) on the adjacent wall 20 ft
(6.1 m) away [60 × 25% ÷ (20 ft) 2 or (60 × 25% ÷ (12.2 m) 2)]
where the minimum light output of the appliance at 90 degrees
off-axis is 25 percent of rated output per ANSI/UL 1971, Stand‐
ard for Signaling Devices for the Hearing Impaired . Similarly, a 110
cd visual notification appliance  will produce at least 0.0375
lumens/ft2 (0.4037 lumens/m 2) in a 54 ft × 54 ft (16.5 m ×
16.5 m) room. Calculated intensities in Table 18.5.5.5.1(a) and
Table 18.5.5.5.1(b) have been adjusted to standardize the
intensity options of presently available products and take into
account additional reflections in room corners and higher
direct viewing probability when there is more than one appli‐
ance in a room.
The application of visual notification appliances in outdoor
areas has not been tested and is not addressed in this Code.

should be listed for outdoor use (under ANSI/UL 1638, Visible
Signaling Devices for Fire Alarm and Signaling Systems, Including
Accessories, for example) and should be located for direct view‐
ing because reflected light will usually be greatly reduced.
Δ A.18.5.5.8.3   For sleeping areas, the use of visual notification
appliances with other intensities at distances greater than 16 ft
(4.9 m) has not been researched and is not addressed in this
Code.
This section on visual notification appliances for alerting
sleeping persons intends that stand-alone visual notification
appliances be located in accordance with 18.5.5. If the visual
notification appliance is an integral part of a smoke detector or
smoke alarm, the unit must be mounted in accordance with the
requirements for the smoke detector or smoke alarm. In either
case (stand-alone or combination), Table 18.5.5.8.3 is then
consulted to determine the minimum required intensity.
Where the appliance is mounted less than 24 in. (610 mm)
from the ceiling, it must have a minimum 177 cd effective
rating because it might be in a smoke layer at the time it is
called upon to operate. If the appliance is 24 in. (610 mm) or
more from the ceiling, it is permitted to be rated 110 cd effec‐
tive or more. Note that the requirement for increasing the
intensity when mounted close to the ceiling applies only to
visual notification appliances used in sleeping areas to awaken
sleeping people. It is assumed that in nonsleeping situations, a
visual notification appliance is not needed to alert someone if
there is a developing smoke layer.
A.18.6   Though the number of visual notification appliances
might be reduced in private operating mode settings, visual
notification appliances might still need to be considered in
spaces occupied by the public or the hearing impaired or
subject to other laws or codes.
A.18.8.1.2   The tone signal is used to evaluate the sound pres‐
sure level produced by loudspeaker appliances because of the
fluctuating sound pressure level of voice or recorded messages.
A.18.9   Textual and graphical visual appliances are selected
and installed to provide temporary text, permanent text, or
symbols. Textual and graphical visual appliances are most
commonly used in the private mode for fire alarm systems. The
use of microprocessors with computer monitors and printers
has resulted in the ability to provide detailed information in
the form of text and graphics to persons charged with directing
emergency response and evacuation. Textual and graphical
visual appliances are also used in the public mode to communi‐
cate emergency response and evacuation information directly
to the occupants or inhabitants of the area protected by the
system. For both private mode and public mode signaling, text
and graphic annunciators can provide information about pre-
alarm, alarm, trouble, and supervisory conditions. Because
textual and graphical visual appliances do not necessarily have
the ability to alert, they should only be used to supplement
audible or visual notification appliances.
Textual and graphical visual information should be of a size
and visual quality that is easily read. Many factors influence the
readability of textual visual appliances, including the following:
(1) Size and color of the text or graphic
(2) Distance from the point of observation
(3) Observation time
(4) Contrast
(5) Background luminance
(6) Lighting

(7) Stray lighting (glare)
(8) Shadows
(9) Physiological factors
While many of these factors can be influenced by the equip‐
ment manufacturer and by the building designers, there is no
readily available method to measure legibility.
Δ A.18.9.4   Parts of this section on text characteristics are based
on Section 703.5 of the updated accessibility guidelines in the
U.S. Access Board’s ADA-ABA-AG.
A.18.9.4.2   Signs are more legible for persons with low vision
when characters contrast as much as possible with their back‐
ground. Additional factors affecting the ease with which the
text can be distinguished from its background include shadows
cast by lighting sources, surface glare, and the uniformity of the
text and its background colors and textures.
Stroke width-to-height ratios are an important part of charac‐
ter legibility and are affected by contrast. Ratios for light char‐
acters on a dark background and dark characters on a light
background differ because light characters or symbols tend to
spread or bleed into the adjacent dark background. To accom‐
modate these differences, recommendations for symbol stroke
width-to-character height ratios are as follows:
(1) Positive image — Dark characters on a light background,
ratio of 1:6 to 1:8
(2) Negative image — Light characters on a dark back‐
ground, ratio of 1:8 to 1:10

Factors Awareness Course available at http://www.hf.faa.gov/
webtraining/Intro/Intro1.htm.
A.18.9.4.4   The use of all uppercase characters in messages
should be avoided as it decreases legibility. The exception is
one- or two-word commands or statements such as stop, go, or
exit stair.
Δ A.18.9.4.7   Paragraph 18.9.4.7 and the associated table does
not apply to text and graphics displayed on desktop monitors.
The Code does not list any specific sizing requirements for
desktop monitors. However, 18.9.3 does require them to be
clear and legible at the intended viewing distance. Other
requirements in 18.9.4 such as contrast, sans serif fonts, and so
forth should still apply to desktop displays. The specific
requirements of Table 18.9.4.7 are taken directly from
Section 703.5 of the updated accessibility guidelines in the U.S.
Access Board’s ADA-ABA-AG. The table has been reformatted
to be consistent with other parts of NFPA 72.
A.18.9.4.8   The minimum height for textual and graphic visual
appliances is given as 40 in. (1.02 m) above the ground or
finished floor. However, the character or symbol sizes should be
based on the height of the highest character or symbol
displayed by the appliance.
A.18.10.2   Notification appliances are available for the deaf
and hard of hearing. These appliances include, but are not
limited to, supplemental tactical notification appliances. Such
tactile notification appliances can be capable of awakening
people. Tactile appliances can initiate in response to the activa‐
tion of an audible smoke alarm, through hard wiring into the
fire alarm system or by wireless methods.
Some tests show that visual notification appliances might not
be effective in awakening some sleeping individuals during an
emergency. Some tactile devices can be more effective in awak‐
ening individuals, regardless of hearing levels, from sleep.
A.18.11   Standard Emergency Service Interface.  Annunciators,
information display systems, and controls for portions of a
system provided for use by emergency service personnel should
be designed, arranged, and located in accordance with the
needs of the organizations intended to use the equipment.
Where annunciators, information display systems, and
controls for portions of the system are provided for use by
emergency service personnel, these should have a common
design and operation to avoid confusion of users.
A.21.1   Fire alarm systems, signaling systems, and emergency
communications systems are often part of a large, integrated
system serving a building or area. Figure A.21.1 shows examples
of individual systems that might be part of an integrated
system.
A fire alarm system might monitor the status of one of the
other individual systems or provide a form of output to control
another individual system, such as a smoke control system or an
elevator controller.
In some cases, the fire alarm system shares information and
control in two directions with another individual system.
NFPA 72 covers only the fire alarm or signaling system in the
circuits powered by it, not any part of the other individual
systems.
See NFPA 3 and NFPA 4 for additional information on inte‐
grated systems.
A.21.2.1   The performance of automatic emergency control
functions refers to their normal operation. For instance, it is all
right to shut down elevator mainline power when the system
has been designed to do so.

NATIONAL FIRE ALARM AND SIGNALING CODE72-260
2019 Edition Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material.
A.21.2.4   Emergency control function interface devices can be
located far from the device to be actuated, such as air-handling
units and exhaust fans located on the roof. The requirement
for monitoring installation wiring for integrity only applies to
the wiring between the fire alarm control unit and the emer‐
gency control function interface device. For example, it does
not apply to the wiring between the emergency control func‐
tion interface device and a motor stop/start control relay, or
between the emergency control function interface device and
the equipment to be controlled (e.g., air-handling units and
exhaust fans). The location of the emergency control function
interface device within 3 ft ( 910 mm) applies to the point of
interface and not to remotely located equipment.
Where Class D circuits are utilized to actuate emergency
control functions (such as but not limited to door closers, AHU
shutdown, and damper controls), the fire alarm control point
is not required to be within 3 ft (910 mm) of the interface
point to the system or device to be controlled. It is important to
note that in some cases these control circuits are not part of
the fire alarm system but rather part of the other systems
performing the functions. See Figure A.3.3.146.1.1 for addi‐
tional details.
Δ A.21.3   The terms machinery space , control space , machine room ,
and control room are defined in NFPA 70 and ASME A17.1/CSA
B44, Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators.
A.21.3.2   In facilities without a building alarm system, dedica‐
ted function fire alarm control units are required by 21.3.2 for
elevator recall in order that the elevator recall systems be moni‐
tored for integrity and have primary and secondary power
meeting the requirements of this Code.
The fire alarm control unit used for this purpose should be
located in an area that is normally occupied and should have
audible and visible indicators to annunciate supervisory (eleva‐
tor recall) and trouble conditions; however, no form of general
occupant notification or evacuation signal is required or inten‐
ded by 21.3.2.
A.21.3.5   Smoke detectors should not be installed in outdoor
locations or locations that are open to the weather (such as
unenclosed elevator lobbies in open parking structures),
because such environments can exceed the parameters of the
detector listing and can result in unwanted alarms. (See
21.3.10.)
N A.21.3.7   Since it is permitted by ASME A17.1/CSA B44, Safety
Code for Elevators and Escalators , to have access for fire alarm
initiating devices installed inside elevator hoistways, the follow‐
ing are examples for proposed methods for providing such
access (other methods could be acceptable if approved by the
authority having jurisdiction):
(1) Provide an access hatch door and associated protective
guard for a spot type fire detector, where the fire detector
is installed within the protective guard.
(2) Provide an air sampling-type detector as specified in
17.7.3.6 installed outside the hoistway with its sampling
tube installed to sample the air within the hoistway.
(3) If heat detection is required, linear heat detectors with
connection points located outside the hoistway or spot
type heat detectors installed in accordance with
A.21.3.7(1) are acceptable.
A.21.3.8   This requirement applies to smoke and heat detec‐
tors installed in the hoistway. It is important to note that the
hoistway includes the pit. The location of smoke or heat detec‐
tors will, most likely, require special consideration in order to
provide the intended response of early detection of fire in the
elevator pit. The location of these detectors will likely need to
be below the lowest level of recall in order to provide an
adequate response. Since there is no real ceiling at this loca‐
tion to allow installation using the spacing provisions of Chap‐
ter 17, the provisions of 17.7.3.1.3 and 17.4.7 should be
considered, which allows detectors to be placed closer to the
hazard in a position where the detector can intercept the
smoke or heat. Also refer to A.21.3.14.2(3).
A.21.3.9   It should be noted that smoke detectors installed in
hoistways can be a source of nuisance activation. Therefore,
hoistways need smoke detectors specifically intended for those
types of spaces (environments).
Δ A.21.3.10   The objective of elevator Phase I Emergency Recall
Operation is to have the elevator automatically return to the
recall level before fire can affect the safe operation of the eleva‐
tor. This includes both the safe mechanical operation of the
elevator, as well as the delivery of passengers to a safe lobby
location. Where ASME A17.1/CSA B44, Safety Code for Elevators
and Escalators, specifies the use of fire alarm initiating devices
used to initiate Phase I Emergency Recall Operation, these
devices are expected to provide the earliest response to situa‐
tions that would require Phase I Emergency Recall Operations.
The use of other automatic fire detection is only intended
where smoke detection would not be appropriate due to the
environment. Where ambient conditions prohibit the installa‐
tion of smoke detectors, the selection and location of other
automatic fire detection should be evaluated to ensure the best
response is achieved. When heat detectors are used, considera‐
tion should be given to both detector temperature and time lag
characteristics (Response Time Index). The consideration of a
low temperature rating alone might not provide the earliest
response. It should be noted that smoke detectors installed in
hoistways can be a source of nuisance activation. Therefore,
hoistways need smoke detectors specifically intended for those
types of spaces (environments). Performance-based selection of
specific automatic fire detection suitable for elevator hoistways
can be based on Annex Bas acceptable to the authority having
jurisdiction.
N A.21.3.14.1   Refer to the definition of Group Automatic Opera‐
tion in ASME A17.1/CSA B44, Safety Code for Elevators and Escala‐
tors.
In addition to performing elevator Phase I Emergency Recall
Operation to the Designated Level, the elevator system, upon
receiving the fire alarm system output specified in 21.3.14.1(1),
21.3.14.1(2), or 21.3.14.1(3), will also actuate the elevator car
visual signal (fire fighter’s hat) in accordance with ASME
A17.1/CSA B44, Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators.
N A.21.3.14.2   Refer to for the definition of Group Automatic Oper‐
ation in ASME A17.1/CSA B44, Safety Code for Elevators and Esca‐
lators.
In addition to preforming elevator Phase I Emergency Recall
Operation to the Alternate Level, the elevator system, upon
receiving the fire alarm system output specified in 21.3.14.2(1),
21.3.14.2(2), or 21.3.14.2(3) will also actuate the elevator car
visual signal (fire fighter’s hat) in accordance with ASME
A17.1/CSA B44, Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators.

Δ A.21.3.14.2(3)   Where initiating devices are located in the
elevator hoistway at or below the lowest level of recall, ASME
A17.1/CSA B44, Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators , requires
that the elevator be sent to the upper recall level. Note that the
lowest level of recall could be the designated level or alternate
level as determined by the local authority for the particular
installation. Also note that the elevator hoistway, as defined in
ASME A17.1, includes the elevator pit.
•
Δ A.21.4.1   When determining desired performance, considera‐
tion should be given to the temperature and response time
characteristics/index (RTI) of both the sprinkler and the heat
detector to ensure that the heat detector will operate prior to
the sprinkler, because a lower temperature rating alone might
not provide earlier response.
Δ A.21.4.2   The purpose of spacing heat detectors in close prox‐
imity to each sprinkler is to ensure the operation of the discon‐
necting means upon heat detection prior to the operation of
any sprinkler installed in those locations. Spot-type heat detec‐
tors or linear heat detectors are acceptable.
Δ A.21.4.3   Care should be taken to ensure that elevator power
cannot be interrupted due to water pressure surges in the
sprinkler system. The intent of the Code is to ensure that the
switch and the system as a whole do not have the capability of
introducing a time delay into the sequence. The use of a switch
with a time delay mechanism set to zero does not meet the
intent of the Code, because it is possible to introduce a time
delay after the system has been accepted. This might occur in
response to unwanted alarms caused by surges or water move‐
ment, rather than addressing the underlying cause of the
surges or water movement (often due to air in the piping).
Permanently disabling the delay in accordance with the manu‐
facturer’s printed instructions should be considered accepta‐
ble.
A.21.4.4   Figure A.21.4.4 illustrates one method of monitoring
elevator shunt trip control power for integrity.
•
N A.21.5   The continuous monitoring of smoke and temperature
is to allow the responding fire fighters to know when the
tenability conditions at the floor elevator lobbies are changing.
This can be accomplished at a minimum by monitoring eleva‐
tor lobbies, machine rooms, control rooms, machinery spaces,
or control spaces smoke detector(s) for the presence of smoke
and a minimum of three ranges of temperature in the elevator
lobbies, machine rooms, machinery spaces, or control rooms
that provide full bodily access for fire fighters, as follows:
(1) Normal ≤90°F (32°C)
(2) Monitoring (supervisory) between 90°F (32°C) and 135°F
(57°C)
(3) Unsafe (alarm) above 135°F (57°C)
Indications at the fire alarm control unit would typically be
as follows:
For smoke:
(1) No indication for normal
(2) Red/alarm messaging or unsafe
For heat:
(1) Green (no indication on fire alarm control unit) for a
normal range
(2) Amber/yellow/supervisory messaging for monitor range
(3) Red/alarm messaging for unsafe
Note 1: Temperature monitoring should not be required in
areas or locations not accessible to fire fighters, such as elevator
control spaces and elevator machinery spaces located inside
the elevator hoistway.
Note 2: If fire service access elevators or occupant evacuation
elevators are provided in buildings not provided with a fire
command center, such as low-rise buildings, the required
annunciator(s) should be installed in another approved loca‐
tion as determined by the authority having jurisdiction.
In most cases, a separate annunciator would be recommen‐
ded to provide an overall status of the elevator lobbies,
machine rooms, or control rooms that provide full bodily
access for fire fighters in the building.
The lowest temperature defined in Table 17.6.2.1, Tempera‐
ture Classification and Color Code for Heat-Sensing Fire Detec‐
tors, is 100°F (38°C), so a thermostat or other approved heat
sensor(s) should be used to monitor temperatures less than
100°F (38°C).
N A.21.6   Refer to the applicable building code for application
requirements and definitions related to occupant evacuation
elevators (OEE). OEE are not required by code, and they will
be provided for a relatively limited number of buildings, mainly
office use high‐rise buildings over 420 ft (128 m) in lieu of a
required additional stairway as a building code exception. They
could also be provided on a voluntary basis in other buildings
due to ADA or mobility of occupants concerns. It is highly
recommended that those involved with design and installation
of these systems become familiar with available information

such as ASME A17.1/CSA B44, Safety Code for Elevators and Esca‐
lators, Section 2.27, regarding occupant evacuation operation
(OEO) and its nonmandatory Appendix V, “Building Features
for Occupant Evacuation Operation.” It will be imperative that
a great amount of coordination and performance-based design
be done between elevator and fire alarm system designers,
installation contractors, and the authority having jurisdiction.
Figure A.21.6 demonstrates the basics of OEO. This is a
simplified flowchart and is not intended to show all required
inputs, outputs, or interfaces. This figure demonstrates some
functions that are dictated by ASME A17.1/CSA B44 for refer‐
ence only. Inclusion of elevator system operations in this figure
is not intended to suggest that the fire alarm system is responsi‐
ble for the feature.
N A.21.6.2.1.1   The term groupautomatic operation  is defined in
ASME A17.1/CSA B44, Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators .
Other terms such as elevator group or group of elevators  are used
in Section 26.6 to refer to those elevators sharing a common
landing call operation. For instance, if an elevator landing call
is registered on a particular floor, any elevator that could
respond to that call would be considered in that elevator
group. Elevators in an elevator group  typically share a lobby,
hoistway, and/or machine/control room or control space.
N A.21.6.2.1.2   When OEO is actuated either manually or auto‐
matically, it is applicable to all elevators serving the floors of
the elevator evacuation zone. However, when a single elevator
or elevator group is placed on manual Elevator Phase I Emer‐
gency Recall Operation, OEO continues to operate for the
other elevator groups serving the elevator evacuation zone.
Similarly, when a fire alarm initiating device(s) described in
21.3.14.1 and 21.3.14.2 is actuated, Elevator Phase I Emergency
Recall Operation will cause recall only to the elevator group
and not to all elevators in the elevator evacuation zone not
associated with that group of recalled elevators. See also
21.6.2.8.
N A.21.6.2.3.1   This signal to the elevator system is caused by the
activation of a fire alarm initiating device other than that which
is described in 21.3.14.1 and 21.3.14.2.
N A.21.6.2.3.2   The elevator evacuation zone would typically be
the floor of an active alarm plus two floors above and two floors
below the floor with the active alarm for a total of five floors or
as otherwise determined by the authority having jurisdiction.

vidual elevator or a group of elevators. More than a single
elevator discharge level can exist in a building.
N A.21.6.2.3.6   If there are different elevator discharge levels in
the building, then separate signals from the fire alarm system
should be sent to each elevator group serving the active alarm
floors to allow for OEO operation of those elevators when the
alarm is not at the elevator discharge level. The fire alarm
system should not send signal(s) to the elevator system to
initiate OEO for a group of elevators when the first active
alarm is at the discharge level for that group. Subsequent active
alarms at any levels should not cause the fire alarm system to
send signal(s) to the elevator system to initiate OEO for that
group of elevators. When the first active alarm is not on the
discharge level, the fire alarm system should send signals to the
elevator system to initiate OEO for that group of elevators and
all subsequent active alarms, including at the elevator discharge
level.
N A.21.6.2.4   The manual selection means such as a switch or a
push button for each floor is intended in lieu of automatic
initiating devices that could be impaired or out of service and
would otherwise have actuated to provide automatic initiation
in accordance with 21.6.2.3. Manual fire alarm boxes are not
included because they are typically actuated at locations
remote from the fire. The manual selection means could also
serve to evacuate the building or portions of the building for
non‐fire-related emergencies. The manual selection means is
required to provide a maintained nonlatching output(s) from
the fire alarm system to the elevator system to prevent the need
for fire alarm system reset upon a wrong or unwanted manual
selection of a floor(s).
N A.21.6.2.5   The fire alarm system uses the floor identification
to automatically establish an elevator evacuation zone for voice
messaging purposes. The elevator system also uses the floor
identification to determine the contiguous block of floors to be
evacuated (elevator evacuation zone, see A.21.6.2.3.2). The
elevator evacuation zone is updated to reflect changing condi‐
tions as indicated by the output signal(s). This information is
sent to the elevator system and also used for occupant notifica‐
tion. The output signals from the fire alarm system can be in
the form of contact closures or serial communications or other
approved means. Coordination needs to be provided between
the fire alarm system installer, the elevator system installer, and
the authority having jurisdiction.
Δ A.21.6.2.6   Prerecorded automatic voice messages provided by
the in‐building fire emergency voice/alarm communications
system need to be coordinated with the variable message signs
provided separately by the elevator system to all affected eleva‐
tor lobbies and floors served by the elevator(s) operating in
OEO so that occupants will understand what to expect and how
to react. Additional visual information will be provided in each
affected elevator lobby by the elevator system to further inform
occupants of the status of the elevators. Refer also to 24.3.6 and
associated Annex A material (Messages for One‐Way Emer‐
gency Communications Systems) for additional information. It
is important to note that all elevator lobbies served by eleva‐
tor(s) operating in OEO, both within the elevator evacuation
zone and on other floors outside that zone, will be considered
as affected lobbies, and they will be provided with variable
messages controlled by the elevator system. The fire alarm
system will not provide automatic voice messages in the affec‐
ted elevator lobbies, but rather it will provide automatic
messages to all floors having those affected lobbies via audible
appliances located outside those lobbies. The messages provi‐
ded by the fire alarm system and the elevator system on the
affected floors and lobbies must be coordinated so as not to
conflict with each other. It is especially important to address
additional automatic or manual alarm actuation(s) and the
impact on expanding the elevator evacuation zone and the
corresponding voice messaging that has to adjust to the
change. Table A.21.6.2.6 gives sample voice message content to
be added to normal messaging (to be coordinated with the
variable message display provided by the elevator contractor).
Voice messaging is permitted to all other floor(s) in the build‐
ing not in the elevator evacuation zone and not served by eleva‐
tor(s) performing OEO in accordance with the facility
emergency response plan approved by the authority having
jurisdiction. For further information on voice messaging strat‐
egies refer to NIST Technical Note 1779, General Guidance on
Emergency Communication Strategies for Buildings and FPRF Elevator
Messaging Strategies.
A.21.6.2.6.3   This new message will require a signal (s) from
the elevator system to the fire alarm system. This signal(s) will
indicate to the fire alarm system  that all elevators serving an
elevator evacuation zone are not available due to Elevator
Phase I Emergency Recall Operation or due to other elevator
condition(s) such as inspection, operation, and malfunction.
N A.21.6.2.6.4   The emergency voice/alarm communications
system’s loudspeaker(s) located in each OEE lobby are not
permitted to transmit automatic voice messages since they
could interrupt occupants using the required OEE elevator
lobby two-way communication system. Therefore, manual
paging zones are required for those loudspeakers by applicable
building code(s). The specific zone selection will be performed
from a fire alarm system paging panel located in the FCC.
Since a very large number of individual paging zones could be
required, it is permitted to group all OEE lobbies’ loudspeak‐
ers per floor or vertically per elevator group as a single paging
zone. The OEE lobby paging zone will be dedicated to loud‐
speakers that only serve OEE lobbies and will be separate from
all other loudspeakers outside of an OEE lobby.
N A.21.6.2.8   Suspension of OEO can occur when an individual
elevator or group of elevators is recalled by fire fighters using
key operated switch(es). It is important to recognize that OEO
continues operation using the available elevator(s). The affec‐

ted elevator(s) will return to OEO operation when fire fighters’
emergency operation has been reset.
N A.21.6.2.9   Partial termination can occur when a particular
group of elevators has been taken out of service because they
have been recalled under automatic Elevator Phase I Emer‐
gency Recall Operation, but other elevator(s) in the elevator
evacuation zone are still available for evacuation.
N A.21.6.2.10   OEO will not actuate if no elevators are available.
There are several instances where signals must be received
from the elevator system. One of these is when the Elevator
Phase I Emergency Recall key switch is used to manually
initiate recall for all elevators. Another situation requiring a
signal from the elevator system is when the elevator system
cannot provide the intended operation. In this case the fire
alarm system needs to know so it does not provide incorrect
messaging to a floor(s). See also A.21.6.2.6.3.
A.21.7.2   This Code does not specifically require detection
devices used to cause the operation of HVAC system smoke
dampers, fire dampers, fan control, smoke doors, or fire doors
to be connected to the fire alarm system.
A.21.10.1   Doors are commonly locked for various security
reasons. Though doors are permitted to be locked to prevent
ingress, doors are generally not permitted to be locked to
restrict egress unless specifically permitted by governing laws,
codes, and standards. Examples of special locking arrange‐
ments include delayed egress locking and access control lock‐
ing. Approved locking requirements by governing laws, codes,
and standards can vary extensively. For example, some might
require all fire alarm initiating devices to immediately unlock
electrically locked egress doors, while others might permit such
doors to remain locked when a single manual fire alarm box is
actuate. Some codes might also permit electrically locked doors
to remain locked when a single smoke detector has actuated.
These allowances are typically permitted only in sprinklered
buildings and are generally used as additional safeguards to
counter efforts to breach security, without compromising occu‐
pant safety.
A.21.10.3   A problem could exist when batteries are used as a
secondary power source if a fire alarm control unit having
24 hours of standby operating power were to lose primary
power and be operated for more than 24 hours from the secon‐
dary power source (batteries). It is possible that sufficient volt‐
age would be available to keep the doors locked, but not
enough voltage would be available to operate the fire alarm
control unit to release the locks.
A.21.11   When a fire alarm evacuation signal actuates, the exit
marking system will be actuated. In some cases, the activation
might be sequenced to meet the fire safety plan of the prop‐
erty.
Δ A.23.1.1   Chapter 23 is intended to cover alarm and signaling
systems and their components, such as fire alarm, mass notifica‐
tion, carbon monoxide, and other signaling systems.
A.23.2.1   Systems can be installed for the purposes of life
safety, property protection, or both. Evacuation or relocation is
not a required output action for every system installed in
accordance with Chapter 23.
A.23.2.2.1.1   Compatibility between software systems is neces‐
sary to ensure that the systems can communicate correctly and
that the overall system can function as intended. Unfortunately,
software that is compatible can become incompatible when the
software is updated. Newer revisions of software might not
maintain compatibility with older revisions. This paragraph
requires that the fire alarm software or firmware that interfaces
with software or firmware in another system is compatible. An
example might be a smoke control system that gets information
from the fire alarm system. The term “required” indicates that
this compatibility requirement is intended for required func‐
tions (e.g., smoke control) and not for supplemental functions
that are not part of the required operation of the fire alarm
system. An example of a supplemental function might be an
RS-232 port that connects to a terminal emulator program used
for maintenance purposes. The term “functionally” is intended
to ensure that the intended functionality is maintained by the
software. It is trying to avoid a situation where a change in soft‐
ware revision might still be compatible but changes the availa‐
ble functionality so that the two systems no longer perform the
intended functions, even though the software communicates
correctly.
A.23.2.2.1.2   Compatibility between systems will be documen‐
ted in one or the other (or both) of the manufacturer’s installa‐
tion documents for the compatible products and controlled by
the listings agencies. This documentation will be referenced in
the marking on the product. The documentation might be
paper copy or electronic media (disk, website, etc.). When a
software revision changes, the documentation can be consulted
to ensure that it is still compatible with the software or firm‐
ware on the other side of the interface.
A.23.2.2.2   A commonly used method of protecting against
unauthorized changes can be described as follows (in ascend‐
ing levels of access):
(1) Access Level 1.  Access by persons who have a general
responsibility for safety supervision, and who might be
expected to investigate and initially respond to a fire
alarm or trouble signal
(2) Access Level 2.  Access by persons who have a specific
responsibility for safety, and who are trained to operate
the control unit
(3) Access Level 3.  Access by persons who are trained and
authorized to do the following:
(a) Reconfigure the site-specific data held within the
control unit, or controlled by it
(b) Maintain the control unit in accordance with the
manufacturer’s published instructions and data
(4) Access Level 4.  Access by persons who are trained and
authorized either to repair the control unit or to alter its
site-specific data or operating system program, thereby
changing its basic mode of operation
N A.23.3.1   Building codes provide requirements for systems
such as sprinklers, fire alarm systems, standpipe systems, and so
forth.
These requirements are based on the occupancy of a build‐
ing. Inspection and testing verifies compliance to the code(s).
Upon completion of all inspection and testing, the authority
having jurisdiction will issue an occupancy permit, allowing
people to utilize the building for its intended use.
Once the occupancy permits have been granted, these
systems are not allowed to be removed or modified without the
approval of the property or building or system owner or the
owner’s designated representative. See 23.6.3.5.

This can create issues when there is not a clear understand‐
ing of the separation between the fire protection system and
the tenant equipment. Class N shared pathways allow for Level
1 or Level 2 pathways to be shared with life safety and non–life
safety equipment as long as the criteria outlined in 23.6.3 is
met. The building system is allowed to leverage the tenant’s
equipment, and in this case the tenant is not allowed to remove
or modify that equipment.
The use of Ethernet (wired or wireless) is an example where
the tenant might have installed an Ethernet infrastructure that
could easily be leveraged for the installation of additional fire
alarm system capacity, but once that system is installed, tested,
and inspected per the code, the IT team can no longer remove
or modify the system without the approval of the property or
building or system owner or the owner’s designated representa‐
tive.
A.23.3.2   Nonrequired fire alarm features are defined in
3.3.180. These are fire alarm systems or components that are
not required by the building or fire codes and are installed
voluntarily by a building owner to meet site-specific fire safety
objectives. There is a need to properly document the nonre‐
quired system and components. Nonrequired components
must be operationally compatible in harmony with other
required components and must not be detrimental to the over‐
all system performance. It is for this reason that 23.3.2.1
mandates that nonrequired (voluntary) systems and compo‐
nents meet the applicable installation, testing, and mainte‐
nance requirements of this Code. It is not the intent of the
Code to have the installation of nonrequired (voluntary)
systems or components trigger a requirement for the installa‐
tion of additional fire alarm components or features in the
building. For example, if a building owner voluntarily installs a
fire alarm control unit to transmit sprinkler waterflow signals to
a central station, that does not trigger a requirement to install
other fire alarm system components or features, such as
manual fire alarm boxes, occupant notification, or electronic
supervision of sprinkler control valves. See also A.17.5.3.3 and
A.18.1.5.
Alternatively, supervision and power requirements are
required to be taken into account for the nonrequired compo‐
nents/systems on the required fire alarm systems.
Δ A.23.3.3.1   The following functions are included in Annex A to
provide guidelines for utilizing building systems and equip‐
ment in addition to proprietary fire alarm equipment in order
to provide life safety and property protection. Building func‐
tions that should be initiated or controlled during a fire alarm
condition include, but should not be limited to, the following:
(1) Elevator operation consistent with ASME A17.1/CSA B44,
Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators
(2) Unlocking of stairwell and exit doors (see NFPA 80 and
NFPA 101)
(3) Release of fire and smoke dampers (see NFPA 90A and
NFPA 90B)
(4) Monitoring and initiating of self-contained automatic fire
extinguishing system(s) or suppression system(s) and
equipment (see NFPA 11, NFPA 12, NFPA 12A, NFPA 13,
NFPA 14, NFPA 15, NFPA 17, NFPA 17A, and NFPA 750)
A.23.3.3.2   Examples of dedicated function fire alarm systems
would include an elevator recall control and supervisory
control unit, as addressed in 21.3.2, or a system used specifi‐
cally to monitor sprinkler waterflow and supervisory functions.
A.23.4.2.2   The intent of this paragraph is to prevent situations
where the signaling line circuit to a device is required to be
one class of operation, while the power circuits, running in the
same raceways and subject to the same threats, are wired to a
lower class of operation. This means that it is possible to have
power wiring connected to a device that is of a different class
than the signaling line or initiating device circuits. One exam‐
ple of where meeting the same minimum performance require‐
ments would still allow different classes of wiring is where the
performance requirements are based on distance or the
number of devices attached to the wires. For example, if the
signaling line circuit supplies 200 devices and the performance
requirement is that not more than 10 devices be lost to a wiring
fault, then the class of wiring on the signaling line circuit will
be Class A, with isolators to protect against shorts. Where the
power wires never supply more than 10 devices, the power
wires could be wired as Class B.
A.23.6.1   The intent of 23.6.1 applies to both short-circuit
faults and open-circuit faults.
Fire alarm and signaling system communications technolo‐
gies have evolved to the point that SLCs are now the prevalent
means of monitoring initiation devices, controlling output devi‐
ces, and communicating between panels, annunciators, and
controllers.
The extent of coverage of traditional IDCs is inherently limi‐
ted based on the quantity of powered initiation devices or code
limitations. Similarly, the extent and coverage of NACs also are
limited by the power required to operate the devices. SLCs,
unlike IDCs and NACs, have few limitations, and it is now
common that a single SLC can monitor and control more than
250 devices. In addition, a single SLC can be the only pathway
by which alarms are initiated, emergency control functions are
controlled, and audible and visual notification appliances are
actuated.
A total catastrophic failure of a fire alarm and life safety
system due to a single open or short on an SLC can negate
most, if not all, of this Code’s requirements for specifying an
acceptable minimum level of performance and reliability for
the protection of life and property from fire.
Designers should carefully consider the potential that a
single SLC short or open caused by a fire or inadvertent
damage to the SLC could disable an entire SLC prior to the
activation of an alarm condition along with the subsequent
alarm signaling and emergency control functions.
With traditional IDCs and NACs, a single open, ground, or
short fault on one circuit could not affect the performance of
other IDCs, NACs, and emergency control circuits. As such, the
occurrence of a single short or open could limit the extent of
the failure to a particular zone or area.
One method for providing an acceptable level of perform‐
ance and reliability of SLCs is to limit the potential catastrophic
failure to one zone, in a way similar to how traditional IDCs
and NACs have been and are now required to do.
A single zone could be designated in the following ways:
(1) By floor where an SLC would not span multiple floors
(2) By floor area, where a large floor would be split into
multiple zones based on a maximum floor area size (e.g.,
22,500 ft2)

ries, which an SLC would not cross
(4) By maximum length or circuit, where an SLC would not
be longer than a predetermined length (e.g., 300 ft)
See the definition of zone ( 3.3.324) and Figure A.23.6.1(a)
through Figure A.23.6.1(d) for additional clarification.
Figure A.23.6.1(a) depicts a Class B SLC with four zones.
Wiring of more zones would require one isolator for each addi‐
tional zone. The isolator can be integrated into the device or a
separate component. If a single short or open occurs beyond
the isolators, only one zone will be affected.
Figure A.23.6.1(b) depicts a Class A SLC with four zones.
Wiring of more zones would require one isolator for each addi‐
tional zone. The isolator can be integrated into the device or a
separate component. If a single short or open occurs, only one
zone will be affected. If a single open occurs, no devices will be
affected.
Figure A.23.6.1(c) depicts a hybrid Class A SLC loop with
Class B SLC branches serving four zones that is designated as a
Class B SLC. Wiring of more zones would require one isolator
for each additional zone. The isolator can be integrated into
the device or a separate component. If a single short occurs,
only one zone will be affected. If a single open occurs, it might
affect only one zone.
Figure A.23.6.1(d) depicts an incorrect Class B SLC configu‐
ration with four zones. If a single short or open occurs, one or
more zones could be affected depending on the location of the
single short.
A.23.6.1.3   The intent is to clarify that the requirement identi‐
fied in 23.6.1 applies only to SLCs that connect to addressable
devices and not to SLCs that interconnect fire alarm control
units (FACU) or transponders.

N A.23.6.1.3(3)   In many cases, existing systems are partially
modified with addressable devices being added as a part of the
scope of work. In this case the SLC might not have been instal‐
led in a manner that could be easily modified to accommodate
isolation modules and/or keep a single SLC loop confined to a
single zone. This condition makes it clear that the require‐
ments of SLC zones do not apply to existing systems that were
not required to meet the zoning requirements of 23.6.1 when
originally installed.
A.23.6.1.5   Possible scenarios in which a designer might
choose to permit loss of more than one zone include a multi‐
story building with a small floor plan footprint where a limited
number of addressable devices are located on the floor (e.g.,
one manual fire alarm box and two automatic fire detection
devices). In this scenario, the designer might choose to include
multiple floors of devices on the same signaling line circuit
because the loss of such devices due to a single SLC short or
open would disable a limited number of devices.
Another scenario could include buildings with a small vesti‐
bule at the top of a stair that exits onto the roof of a building.
The vestibule might contain one manual fire alarm box and
one or two automatic fire detection devices that could be
connected to the signaling line circuit on the floor below and
considered the same zone.
Designers providing documents for upgrades to an existing
building where the control units and all fire alarm system devi‐
ces are being replaced but some portion of the existing circuits
are being reused might, because of constructability reasons, opt
for combining zones and the associated risk of the loss of those
devices due to a single SLC short or open.
The intent of 23.6.1.5 is not to impose an unnecessary
burden on building owners with existing systems undergoing
renovations, upgrades, or replacements. In these scenarios as

well as others, the designer would be required to provide a
documented, performance-based design approach to justify
why the loss of more than one zone is acceptable. Documenta‐
tion must be composed in accordance with 23.6.2.4 and be
submitted in accordance with 7.3.7.5.
N A.23.6.2   Class N systems should mitigate risk that could be
present when a zone or area is serviced by a single Class N
device. However, 23.6.2 is not intended to automatically
require the installation of twice as many (or more) Class N
devices as compared to a design based on Class A, B, or X path‐
ways. The risks inherent to Class N are different from the risks
inherent to Class A, B, or X.
Class A and B pathways are permitted to lose devices in a
zone (see Section 23.6) upon a multiple ground-fault pathway
failure. Class A and B pathways require a single ground to be
annunciated as a trouble signal. The requirement is to annun‐
ciate the first ground fault and alert the user so that the
ground fault can be addressed before a possible second ground
fault occurs. Note that a second ground fault is also annunci‐
ated at the systems operator interface because communication
is lost.
Class X pathways are not permitted to lose devices in a zone
(see Section 23.6) upon a multiple ground-fault pathway failure
that results in a short circuit across the pathway. Class X path‐
ways require a single ground to be annunciated as a trouble
signal. The requirement is to annunciate the first ground fault
and alert the user so that the ground fault can be addressed
before a possible second ground fault occurs.
By contrast, Class N is not required to report a trouble
condition at the occurrence of the first ground fault because it
limits the loss to a single device if another ground occurs. A
second ground fault in the Class N pathway, like Class A and B
pathways, annunciates a trouble condition at the systems opera‐
tor interface because communication is lost.
In summary, the potential risk of a loss of fire alarm function
in an area must be considered in Class N network design.
Multiple ground faults might cause such a loss in an area, espe‐
cially after no one was alerted of a trouble condition at the first
ground fault.
The term “device” in this context should be understood in
conjunction with the definition of Device (Class N) 3.3.71 and
the associated annex material A.3.3.71. An area is a separated
space within a zone where initiating devices or notification
appliances are required. Examples include an office, confer‐
ence rooms, or temporary partitioned banquet rooms where
alarm notification is required. Factors to consider when deter‐
mining the need for multiple Class N devices within an area or
zone include the following: whether the space is acoustically
and/or visually isolated; specific audible and visual indication
of trouble to the occupants in that area for a related ground-
fault pathway failure of any device/appliance in that area; the
pathways to devices in the area are not susceptible to ground
faults such as fiber or wireless pathways.
Also, multiple devices are not required when devices/appli‐
ances are connected by redundant pathways. For example,
consider the dual port devices deployed as per A.12.3.6(5). For
example, the failure of a sole Class N initiating device might
delay or prevent the timely initiation of an alarm.
Depending on the facility and the risks for that occupancy,
areas serviced by single devices, without redundant pathways,

that are susceptible to ground faults should be established by
the system designer and approved by the authority having juris‐
diction.
N A.23.6.2.3   This requirement is to ensure that devices without
redundant pathways are not used to terminate additional
equipment such that a loss of the pathway would result in more
than one device failure to communicate and operate as inten‐
ded. This stipulation does not apply to dual port devices as
described in A.12.3.6(5), because these devices support redun‐
dant pathways. A dual port device that is used to daisy-chain
additional devices without a redundant pathway would be
prohibited.
The term “device” in this context should be understood in
conjunction with the definition of Device (Class N) 3.3.71 and
the associated annex material A.3.3.71.
A network-based audio amplifier is an example of an
addressable device that can receive a digital audio input from
the Class N pathway and then provide a notification appliance
circuit (NAC) output with Class A, B, or X pathways. Other
endpoint devices can similarly provide alternate class pathways
for visual notification appliances (strobes) (NACs) or initiating
devices (IDCs). From the perspective of the Class N pathway,
communications terminates at this endpoint device. However,
since these types of endpoints can support multiple notification
appliance devices or initiating devices, Class N path segments
are still subject to the redundant pathway requirement unless
protected in an enclosure or raceway less than 20 ft (6 m) in
length. [See Figure A.12.3.6(1)(c).]
N A.23.6.2.4   This clause is a consequence of the definition of
Class N, which permits a single pathway to be used when only
one device is served. [See 12.3.6(1).] This exception to the
requirement of redundant pathways allows for the loss of
operational capability to a single device. Unplugging, ground‐
ing, or cutting any single Ethernet cable or conductor cannot
affect more than one Ethernet device and cannot affect addi‐
tional devices, Ethernet or otherwise, in the system.
N A.23.6.3.3   All shared pathways defined as Class N should be
documented, including all equipment connected to the shared
pathways, interconnecting methods identifying required redun‐
dant communication pathways, end points, techniques used for
proper supervision, and possible risk due to shared pathway
failures. As an example, for wired Ethernet, the designer might
want to use cabling techniques identified in standards such as
ISO/IEC 14763-3, Informational technology — Implementation and
operation of customer premises cabling — Part 3: Testing of optical
fibre cabling, to satisfy the requirements of the authority having
jurisdiction.
N A.23.6.3.3.1.2   Cable installations should be tested with appro‐
priate field test measurement equipment in accordance with
applicable standards such as TIA 526, Standard Test Procedures for
Fiber Optic Systems , or other standards acceptable to the author‐
ity having jurisdiction. For example, testing requirements for
Category 5 or higher balanced twisted-pair cabling should
include the following:
(1) Wire map (e.g., continuity, pairing)
(2) Length
(3) Insertion loss
(4) NEXT loss
(5) ACR-F (formerly called ELFEXT)
(6) Propagation delay and delay skew
(7) Return loss
(8) Power sum near-end crosstalk (PSNEXT) loss
(9) PSACR-F (formerly called PSELFEXT)
Testing requirements for optical fiber cabling should include
the following:
(1) Attenuation
(2) Optical bandwidth
(3) Length
N A.23.6.3.3.2   All ports need to be properly identified and
labeled. For example, Class N switches should be permanently
labeled “LIFE SAFETY EQUIPMENT – NO UNAUTHORIZED
USE,” or plugs should be used to prevent access.
N A.23.6.3.3.3.2   Life safety Class N network cabling, equipment,
and infrastructure might include (but is not limited to) Ether‐
net switches, media converters, uninterruptible power supplies,
separate life safety network dedicated branch circuit power,
cabling cross connects, and both copper and fiber cabling.
N A.23.6.3.5.1   Regular inspection, testing, and maintenance are
conducted on life safety systems. In traditional systems a single
certified entity was typically capable of servicing the fire alarm
control unit, transport equipment, and/or wiring associated
with it. Class N systems will often use modern network infra‐
structure that might fall outside the expertise of the life safety–
certified entity, or other building systems could share the infra‐
structure used to create the Class N network. The property or
building or system owner or the owner’s designated representa‐
tive has responsibility to maintain a list of certified entities that
are capable of servicing and maintaining the life safety system
and the Class N network. This is what NFPA 72 refers to as a
management organization . For example, if the Class N network
runs through Ethernet switches and routers, the premises IT
infrastructure should be maintained by service personnel as
referenced in 10.5.3.3.
N A.23.6.3.5.2   During inspection, testing, or maintenance it
could be necessary to temporarily disable or test part of a life
safety system. The management organization  is responsible to
ensure that other affected entities are notified and action plans
put in place to ensure appropriate life safety coverage is main‐
tained and appropriate notification is given to other entities
such as the fire or security monitoring services.
N A.23.6.3.6.1   When shared pathway Level 1 or Level 2 is
employed, care should be taken to ensure that the life safety
system(s) traffic has priority over other systems sharing the
Class N network to maintain the required bandwidth. Other
systems might have unspecified or unpredictable bandwidth
usage (such as a manually controlled security camera); there‐
fore, the analysis should specify the method(s) used to ensure
the required life safety bandwidth is maintained under all
circumstances. The network design analysis should show this
and be signed by the property or building or system owner or
the owner’s designated representative responsible for the
design for the authority having jurisdiction to review.
N A.23.6.3.6.2   Primary and backup power should meet the
requirements of NFPA 72 . Life safety equipment and their
connected equipment (Class N transport devices when not
powered by the FACU) should utilize dedicated branch circuits
for primary power. This is to prevent other loads from tripping
a circuit breaker connected to the FACU and to prevent inad‐
vertent disconnecting of primary power to the FACU.

The branch circuit disconnecting means (circuit breakers)
should be clearly labeled and made only accessible to author‐
ized personnel.
FACUs are required to have a secondary power source that
must last for 24 hours of standby (nonalarm) power followed
by either 5 (non-voice systems) or 15 (voice systems) minutes of
alarm power. This is typically accomplished by backup batteries
or by an emergency generator. All transport equipment not
powered by the FACU has the same requirement. The analysis
should document the calculation of all power requirements
(standby and alarm) of the FACU and transport equipment to
ensure that the system can meet this requirement. To meet this
requirement, non–life safety systems could be disconnected
from the secondary power source.
N A.23.6.3.7.1   Maintenance is a critical aspect of fire alarm
systems, and a plan needs to be in place to empower continued
operation of the fire alarm system. Shared Class N pathways
present a unique concern in that non–fire alarm technicians
could perform maintenance or changes to the Class N equip‐
ment or pathways. For example, routine updates to software in
the routers and switches or upgrades to address new non–fire
alarm needs. This could result in outages of the portions of the
fire alarm system or affect the subsequent operation of the fire
alarm system. It is crucial that the maintenance plan address
policy and procedure to monitor, maintain, and test per Chap‐
ter 14 and control change of the shared pathways to contribute
to continued intended operation of the fire alarm system. For
example, 14.4.2.5 states that changes to system executive soft‐
ware require a 10 percent functional test of the system, includ‐
ing typical network infrastructure such as routers and switches
that now need consideration as part of the life safety network
maintenance plan.
N A.23.6.3.7.2   Written procedures should address who can
access the Class N network; how the procedures will be imple‐
mented; the level of retesting of the system needed when soft‐
ware updates to the Class N network infrastructure such as
routers and switches are made; and the effect of changes on
system response times to ensure required time limits are main‐
tained.
A.23.6.3.7.2(3)   The planned impairment process is used to
control change in the system and inform stakeholders. Any
activities that can affect the performance of the network or
impact conclusions of a risk analysis should be presented to the
organization referred to in 23.6.3.5 for approval. The organiza‐
tion should have a name (e.g., Life Safety Network Manage‐
ment Group). All stakeholders who could be affected by
network outages should have representation in the organiza‐
tion.
A committee made up of members of the organization
should meet on a regular basis and report to the organization.
All planned impairments should have 7 days’ notice. An emer‐
gency impairment (one with less than 7 days’ notice) should
meet very stringent standards for urgency. Outages and repair
operations are dealt with on a case by case basis with the fire
marshal’s office, and the Department of Public Safety is inclu‐
ded based on the operational impact.
All proposed changes and outages are to be presented to the
organization for authorization, scheduling, and coordination.
Once a change has been authorized and scheduled, an impair‐
ment notification is issued notifying all affected users. If
specific mitigation actions, such as fire watch, are required,
they are to be included in the impairment notification.
Impairment notifications are issued through the fire
marshal’s office, the Department of Public Safety, the Power
Outages Group, or other groups depending on the systems
affected.
A “login banner” is a programmable option for network
switches and routers. This banner is the first thing that comes
up on the screen when you log into the equipment. Where
practical, network equipment used in life safety systems should
have a login banner to notify service personnel that the
network is a part of an active life safety system and any impair‐
ment should be coordinated with the named organization.
N A.23.6.3.8   Although this section outlines some specific criteria
and/or limitations, each application should be based on recog‐
nized performance-based design practices and the emergency
response plan developed for the specific facility. Here are the
general categories of questions that might be presented to the
stakeholders responsible for Class N shared network design
decisions. The actual questions for each project must be tail‐
ored to the area, the building, the campus, and the culture of
the user organization and the nature of how the network is
being shared. The requirements for the life safety network
should be evaluated with respect to the types of emergency
events and emergency response plan. The potential impact of
these events upon the life safety network also should be evalu‐
ated.
(1) What types of emergency events could affect the life safety
network (e.g., fire, security, safety, health, environmental,
geological, meteorological, utility service disruption, or
other types of events)?
(2) What is the anticipated or expected severity of the emer‐
gency events, that is, how will they impact the facility and
its functions? Are they expected to be extreme, severe,
and so forth?
(3) What is the certainty of the emergency event, that is, is it
happening now, is it very likely to occur, is it likely to
occur, is it possible that it will occur in the future, is it
unlikely to occur, or is its occurrence unknown?
(4) Natural hazards: What are the network risks to the imple‐
mentation of the emergency response plan in response to
natural hazard events? What are the types of emergency
events that could be predicted to result from natural
hazard events? For example, if flooding is possible in the
surrounding area, how would a flood affect the life safety
network while operating in its normal, monitored state?
What would happen if a fire alarm occurred during a
flood? How likely is it that a flood could damage the life
safety network? What related events might impact the life
safety network and equipment, such as a power outage?
(5) Human caused: What are the network risks to the imple‐
mentation of the emergency response plan in response to
accidents or intentional acts? What are the types of emer‐
gency events that could be predicted from both within
and outside the protected premises? What type of related
damage might be expected to impact the life safety
network and equipment, such as explosions?
(6) Technological caused: What are the network risks to the
implementation of the emergency response plan in
response to technologically caused events or failures and
the types of emergency events that could be predicted to
result from a technologically caused event both within

and outside the protected premises. What type of related
damage might be expected to impact the life safety
network and equipment, such as a network attack?
(7) Network maintenance risks: What are the network risks to
the implementation of the emergency response plan in
response to a degradation of network software perform‐
ance (e.g., an unintended degradation of performance
due to software updates) or a degradation of physical
network performance or implementation (e.g., physical
damage, system modifications)? What types of emergency
events could be predicted to result from a degradation of
the life safety network? What type of related impairments
might be expected to impact the components of the life
safety network and equipment, such as environmental
controls?
The questions suggested in items (1) through (7) are
offered for consideration, and not all of them might be appro‐
priate for every life safety network installation.
A.23.8.1.1   A system provided with an alarm verification
feature as permitted by 23.8.5.4.1 is not considered a presignal
system, since the delay in the signal produced is 60 seconds or
less and requires no human intervention.
A.23.8.1.2.1.1(6)   “Immediately actuated” means there are no
delays imposed by the system other than the processing of the
signal in accordance with 23.8.1.1.
A.23.8.1.2.1.2   The bypass means is intended to enable auto‐
matic or manual day, night, and weekend operation.
A.23.8.2   This Code addresses field installations that intercon‐
nect two or more listed control units, possibly from different
manufacturers, that together fulfill the requirements of this
Code.
Such an arrangement should preserve the reliability,
adequacy, and integrity of all alarm, supervisory, and trouble
signals and interconnecting circuits intended to be in accord‐
ance with the provisions of this Code.
Where interconnected control units are in separate build‐
ings, consideration should be given to protecting the intercon‐
necting wiring from electrical and radio frequency
interference.
A.23.8.2.7.4   Where interconnected fire alarm control units
have unsupervised form C contacts that change status during a
trouble condition, annunciators installed at each control unit
provide status indication.
A.23.8.4.1   The provisions of 23.8.4.1 apply to types of equip‐
ment used in common for fire alarm systems, such as fire
alarm, sprinkler supervisory, or guard's tour service, and for
other systems, such as burglar alarm or coded paging systems,
and to methods of circuit wiring common to both types of
systems. The intent of connecting non-fire systems with the fire
alarm system is often to cause the non-fire systems to react
appropriately when signaled by the fire alarm system.
N A.23.8.4.2.1   Buildings are advancing with technologies in
HVAC, security, elevators, energy controls, and lighting. Build‐
ing operators and designers expect to be able to integrate vari‐
ous building systems with human interfaces.
First responders are embracing new technologies, and the
fire life safety systems have a lot of information to assist them in
emergency response and also system evaluation.
For the first time, NFPA 72  introduces the use of the
common PC workstation technology having the UL listing for
“shock and hazard” to be a part of the total building system
without the UL 864 listing, which was a hindrance to the
advancements in technologies.
N A.23.8.4.2.2.2   When the BSIU is not available to control the
fire alarm system, the FACU within the room must be able to
perform all the necessary controls of the fire alarm system with‐
out relying on the BSIU.
A.23.8.4.4   For systems such as carbon monoxide detection,
fire extinguisher electronic monitoring device, emergency
communications (mass notification), or intrusion, much of the
benefit of a combination system comes from being able to use
common wiring. If the equipment in the combination system is
of equivalent quality to fire alarm equipment, and the system
monitors the wiring and equipment in the same way as fire
alarm equipment, then sharing of wiring is permitted. If the
equipment is not of equivalent quality, isolation between the
systems would be required.
A.23.8.4.7   Examples of signal classification are provided in
Table A.23.8.4.7. This is not all-inclusive or prescriptive but is
meant to illustrate a potential classification scheme. Actual
schemes might vary depending upon the emergency response
plan and/or requirements of the authority having jurisdiction.
Mass notification systems are allowed to take priority over the
fire alarm audible notification message or signal. This is inten‐
ded to allow the mass notification system to prioritize emer‐
gency signals on the basis of risk to building occupants. The
designer should specify the desired operation, in particular, as
to what should occur immediately after the mass notification
message has completed.
A.23.8.4.9   See NFPA 720 for more information.
A.23.8.4.9.2   Response to carbon monoxide alarm signals
could include, but not be limited to, any one of the following:
immediate evacuation of occupants, immediate call to the fire
department or other responding authorities, relocation of
occupants to another portion of the building, investigation of
the area identified, and/or opening of all doors and windows
to the outside in the area identified.
A.23.8.4.10   See NFPA 10 for more information on portable
fire extinguishers.
A.23.8.5.1.2   The manual means required by 23.8.5.1.2 is
intended to provide a backup means to manually actuate the
fire alarm system when the automatic fire detection system or
waterflow devices are out of service due to maintenance or test‐
ing, or where human discovery of the fire precedes automatic
sprinkler system or automatic detection system activation.
The manual fire alarm box required by 23.8.5.1.2 should be
connected to a separate circuit that is not placed “on test”
when the detection or sprinkler system is placed “on test.” The
manual means is only intended for use by the system technician
or the building owner and should be located by the sprinkler
riser or fire alarm control unit.
A.23.8.5.3.2   Where power is supplied separately to the individ‐
ual initiating device(s), multiple initiating circuits are not
prohibited from being monitored for integrity by a single
power supervision device.
A.23.8.5.4.1   The alarm verification feature should not be used
as a substitute for proper detector location/applications or

regular system maintenance. Alarm verification features are
intended to reduce the frequency of false alarms caused by
transient conditions. They are not intended to compensate for
design errors or lack of maintenance.
A.23.8.5.4.6.3   Where a separate power source is provided for a
duct smoke detector, consideration should be given to provide
a secondary power source for the duct detector power source as
a power failure to the duct detector will (or should) indicate a
trouble condition on the fire panel. If the system is connected
to an off-premises monitoring station, a trouble signal will be
sent immediately upon power failure. This is in contrast to the
intent and requirements to delay the off-premises reporting of
primary power failures.
A.23.8.5.5   This Code does not specifically require a waterflow
alarm initiating device to be connected to the building fire
alarm system. Connection to the building fire alarm system
would be determined by the requirements established by the
authority having jurisdiction. See A.1.2.4.
A.23.8.5.5.3   Circuits connected to a signaling line circuit
interface are initiating device circuits and are subject to these
limitations.
A.23.8.5.6   This Code does not specifically require supervisory
signal initiating devices to be connected to the building fire
alarm system. Connections to the building fire alarm system
would be determined by the requirements established by the
authority having jurisdiction. See A.1.2.4. Some systems utilize
nonelectrical methods to supervise conditions of the system
such as chains on sprinkler control valves.
Supervisory signals are not intended to provide indication of
design, installation, or functional defects in the supervised
systems or system components and are not a substitute for regu‐
lar testing of those systems in accordance with the applicable
standard. Supervised conditions should include, but not be
limited to, the following:
(1) Control valves 11∕2 in. (38.1 mm) or larger
(2) Pressure, including dry pipe system air, pressure tank air,
preaction system supervisory air, steam for flooding
systems, and public water
(3) Water tanks, including water level and temperature
(4) Building temperature, including areas such as valve closet
and fire pump house
(5) Electric fire pumps, including running (alarm or supervi‐
sory), power failure, and phase reversal
(6) Engine-driven fire pumps, including running (alarm or
supervisory), failure to start, controller off “automatic,”
and trouble (e.g., low oil, high temperature, overspeed)
(7) Steam turbine fire pumps, including running (alarm or
supervisory), steam pressure, and steam control valves
A.23.8.5.6.3   Circuits connected to a signaling line circuit
interface are initiating device circuits and are subject to these
limitations.
A.23.8.5.6.4   Some ball valves installed on air pressure lines
connected to a pressure switch for dry pipe sprinkler systems or
certain types of preaction sprinkler systems will cause the air
pressure that is trapped in the line between the valve and the
supervisory signal initiating device to bleed off when the valve
is turned to isolate the initiating device. This will cause the
initiating device to operate and signal the low air supervisory
condition. The arrangement is permitted by other standards
and provides a fail-safe way to test a low air pressure signal with‐
out risking activation of the system.
A.23.8.5.8   See A.23.8.5.6.
A.23.8.6.2   The general purpose of the fire alarm audible and
visual notification appliances is to alert occupants that there is
a fire condition and for occupants to exit from the building.
Once the occupants are in the exit enclosures, high noise
levels and light intensity from notification appliances could
cause confusion and impede egress. There could be conditions
that warrant the installation of notification appliances in exit
passageways, but careful analysis is necessary to avoid impeding
exiting from the building.
N A.23.8.6.3.3   The building’s emergency response plan might
specify occupant notification only in the area(s) of initiation
and at the control panel. Whole building evacuation might not
be specified in the emergency response plan.
Δ A.23.10.2   One or more of the following means might be
considered acceptable to provide a level of survivability consis‐
tent with the intent of this requirement:
(1) Installing a fire alarm system in a fully sprinklered build‐
ing in accordance with NFPA 13
(2) Routing notification appliance circuits separately
(3) Using short-circuit fault-tolerant signaling line circuits for
controlling evacuation signals
The requirement for notification appliances to operate in
those notification zones that are not attacked by fire will also
require that circuits and equipment that are common to more
than one signaling zone be designed and installed such that
the fire will not disable them. For instance, a signaling line
circuit used to control notification appliances in multiple noti‐
fication zones should be properly designed and installed so

that one fire would not impair more than one notification
zone. Power supply requirements of Chapter 10 apply to these
systems. The secondary power supply requirements of that
chapter meet the intent of these survivability requirements.
A.23.11.7   Automatic fire suppression systems referred to in
23.11.7 include, but are not limited to, preaction and deluge
sprinkler systems, carbon dioxide systems, Halon systems, and
dry chemical systems.
A.23.12.4   Off-site logging of fire alarm data can be useful to
preserve information in the face of fire or building failure to
facilitate accurate reconstruction of the event. It can also be
beneficial to send data off-premises to incident command
personnel to enhance situational awareness and response deci‐
sions and to maintain safe and efficient operations. Figure
A.23.12.4 shows an example of a network to accomplish these
goals.
A.23.16   The term wireless has been replaced with the term low-
power radio  to eliminate potential confusion with other trans‐
mission media such as optical fiber cables.
Low-power radio devices are required to comply with the
applicable low-power requirements of Title 47, Code of Federal
Regulations, Part 15.
A.23.16.1   Equipment listed solely for dwelling unit use would
not comply with this requirement.
A.23.16.2   This requirement is intended to limit the impact
from the failure of a battery operated receiver/transmitter in a
given space. This requirement is not intended to prevent a
single device that contains multiple function elements, such as
a combination carbon monoxide and smoke detector, a detec‐
tor with an independently controllable sounder, a notification
appliance with visible and audible elements, and so forth. This
requirement is intended to limit the number of functional
elements to one of each independent type. For example, two
manual fire alarm boxes could not rely on a single battery.
A.23.16.3.1   This requirement is not intended to preclude veri‐
fication and local test intervals prior to alarm transmission.
•
N A.23.16.3.1.3   This requirement ensures that an alarm is
received in the rare event that the RF channel experiences
interference.
N A.23.16.3.1.5   Trouble and supervisory signals are not required
to latch. Self-restoring trouble and supervisory signals are
acceptable.
A.24.1.2   An emergency communications system could target
the general building, area, space, campus, or region.
A.24.3.1.1   In certain situations, it is important to provide a
distributed sound level with minimal sound intensity variations
to achieve an intelligible voice message. This differs from past
fire alarm design practice that used fewer notification applian‐
ces but with each having greater sound pressure output levels.
Nonemergency system design practice is to use more loud‐
speakers and less sound intensity from each loudspeaker.
Besides improving intelligibility of the message, this approach
minimizes annoyance to building occupants from the system
and lessens the likelihood of tampering with the system by
occupants because of loudspeakers being too loud. In other
applications, such as outdoor signaling where reverberation is
not a problem, intelligibility can be achieved by using fewer
appliances or clusters of appliances covering larger areas.
Intelligibility is a complex function of the source audio, the
acoustic response of the architectural features and materials of

the immediate vicinity, and the dynamics created by the room’s
occupants. Refer to Annex D for more information on speech
intelligibility and how it is predicted. Spacing loudspeakers
closely can be an intelligibility-enhancing technique but can
occasionally lead to opposite results when improperly
designed. There are several techniques using directionality
features that do not use closely spaced loudspeakers but rather
use the room/space acoustic response in their favor.
A.24.3.1.2   In certain acoustically challenging areas, listed fire
alarm loudspeakers might not be capable of producing an
intelligible message. Non–fire alarm listed loudspeakers are
permitted to be installed in these limited areas. A failure of a
non-listed loudspeaker should not disrupt the operation of
listed fire alarm loudspeakers and operation of the fire alarm
or mass notification control equipment. Typically, a dedicated
loudspeaker circuit and other audio components such as
amplifiers could be necessary to meet this functionality.
Δ A.24.3.2   Users who speak too softly, too loudly, or who hold a
microphone too close, too far, or at an incorrect angle can
introduce distortion or cause reduced intelligibility of the
spoken message. The characteristics of the system microphone
are important ergonomic factors that affect voice intelligibility.
Some microphones need to be held close to the mouth,
perhaps an inch or less. Others need to be three or four inches
away. How is the user to know what’s ideal? A simple diagram
next to the microphone can help. Some microphones are very
directional and must be held flat in front of the mouth. These
microphones are useful in small command centers, since they
are less likely to pick up conversations off to the sides. On the
other hand, microphones with a wider polar sensitivity are
more forgiving for a user to hold comfortably while moving
and doing other tasks. Their downside is that they will pick up
extraneous noise in poorly designed command centers intro‐
duced into the microphone.
A.24.3.3   The requirements found in NFPA 70  Article 708,
should be considered for emergency communications systems
that are installed in vital infrastructure facilities classified as a
designated critical operations area (DCOA). This includes
facilities that, if destroyed or incapacitated, would disrupt
national security, the economy, public health or safety and
where enhanced electrical infrastructure for continuity of oper‐
ation has been deemed necessary by governmental authority.
A.24.3.4   The features for a nonrequired system should be
established by the system designer on the basis of the goals and
objectives intended by the system owner.
A.24.3.5.2   Dedicated in-building fire emergency voice/alarm
communications systems are not required to monitor the integ‐
rity of the notification appliance circuits while active for emer‐
gency purposes. However, these circuits have to be monitored
for integrity while active for non-emergency purposes. The
building operator, system designer, and authority having juris‐
diction should be aware that, in some situations, such a system
could be subject to deliberate tampering. Tampering is usually
attempted to reduce the output of a sound system that is in
constant use, such as background music or a paging system,
and that could be a source of annoyance to employees.
The likelihood of tampering can be reduced through proper
consideration of loudspeaker accessibility and system opera‐
tion.
Access can be reduced through the use of hidden or
nonadjustable transformer taps (which can reduce playback
levels), use of vandal-resistant listed loudspeakers, and place‐
ment in areas that are difficult to access, such as high ceilings
(any ceiling higher than could be reached by standing on a
desk or chair). Non-emergency operation of the system should
always consider that an audio system that annoys an employee
potentially reduces employee productivity and can also annoy
the public in a commercial environment. Most motivations for
tampering can be eliminated through appropriate use of the
system and employee discipline. Access to amplification equip‐
ment and controls should be limited to those authorized to
make adjustments to such equipment. It is common practice to
install such equipment in a manner that allows adjustment of
non-emergency audio signal levels while defaulting to a fixed,
preset level of playback when operating in emergency mode.
Under extreme circumstances, certain zones of a protected
area might require a dedicated in-building fire emergency
voice/alarm communications zone.
A.24.3.6.1   See Annex G.
A.24.3.6.2   See Annex G.
A.24.3.6.3   See Annex G.
A.24.3.7   One-way emergency communications systems are
intended to broadcast information, in an emergency, to person‐
nel in one or more specified indoor or outdoor areas. It is
intended that emergency messages be conveyed either by audi‐
ble or visual textual means or both. This section does not apply
to bells, horns, or other sounders and visual notification appli‐
ances, except where used in conjunction with the desired oper‐
ation of emergency messages and signaling.
Two-way emergency communications systems are divided
into two categories, those systems that are anticipated to be
used by building occupants and those systems that are to be
used by fire fighters, police, and other emergency services
personnel. Two-way emergency communications systems are
used both to exchange information and to communicate infor‐
mation, such as, but not limited to, instructions, acknowledge‐
ment of receipt of messages, condition of local environment,
and condition of persons, and to give assurance that help is on
its way.
NFPA 72 contains requirements that can impact the applica‐
tion of emergency communications systems. For instance, coor‐
dination of the functions of an emergency communications
system with other systems that communicate audibly and/or
visibly [such as fire alarm systems, security systems, public
address (PA) systems] is essential in order to provide effective
communication in an emergency situation. Conflicting or
competing signals or messages from different systems could be
very confusing to occupants and have a negative impact on the
intended occupant response. Where independent systems
using audible and/or visual notification are present, the emer‐
gency communications system needs to interface with those
systems to effect related control actions such as deactivating
both audible and visual notification appliances. The use of a
single integrated combination system might offer both
economic and technical advantages. In any case, coordination
between system functions is essential. The coordination of
emergency communications systems with other systems should
be considered part of the risk analysis for the emergency
communications system. (See Figure A.24.3.7.)

Additional documents such as ANSI/NEMA Standard SB-40,
Communications Systems for Life Safety in Schools , can also be used
as supplemental resources to provide help with risk assessment
and application considerations.
N A.24.3.7.1   Other codes reference NFPA 72 with respect to the
emergency voice alarm communications (EVAC) systems or
design and installation requirements. If EVAC systems are
required, they are also required to be listed per UL 864, Stand‐
ard for Control Units and Accessories for Fire Alarm Systems .
However, owners or designers might identify risks in addition
to fire that might also require additional emergency communi‐
cations systems such as in-building mass notification system
(MNS), wide-area MNS, or distributed recipient MNS. If an
MNS is included in the design, a risk analysis is required by
24.3.12. In consideration of the risk analysis, related design
could include combinations of the emergency communications
systems options presented in 24.3.7.1. For example, depending
on the specifics of the facility under consideration, the design
could include combination systems or other combinations of
separate EVAC UL 864 and equipment listed per UL 2572,
Mass Notification Systems, as long as these systems are inter‐
faced in compliance with Chapter 24 and are approved by the
AHJ.
A.24.3.8   The layers can be used in combination. In all cases,
the system design needs to follow the risk analysis and be inte‐
grated into the emergency response plan. Research has shown
that more than one layer has been used to be effective. Multi‐
ple layers provide an extra level of notification (a safety net).
The overall MNS application is likely to exploit a number of
public and individual systems or components that combine to
produce a reliable and robust solution to achieve emergency
notification objectives.
Layer 1 could consist of elements such as the following:
(1) Emergency voice/alarm communications systems
(EVACS)
(2) In-building mass notification system (MNS)
(3) One-way voice communication systems (PA)
(4) Two-way voice communication systems
(5) Visual notification appliances
(6) Textual/digital signage/displays
Layer 2 could consist of elements such as the following:
(1) Wide-area outdoor MNS
(2) High power loudspeaker arrays (HPLAs)
Layer 3 could consist of elements such as the following:
(1) Short message service (SMS)
(2) Email
(3) Computer pop-ups
(4) Smartphone applications (apps)
(5) Reverse 911/automated dialing
Layer 4 could consist of elements such as the following:
(1) Radio broadcast (satellite, AM/FM)
(2) Television broadcast (satellite, digital)

A.24.3.12.1   Although this chapter outlines some specific crite‐
ria and/or limitations, each application should be based on
recognized performance-based design practices and the emer‐
gency response plan developed for the specific facility.
Here are the general categories of questions that might be
presented to the senior manager responsible for mass notifica‐
tion decisions. The actual questions for each project must be
tailored to the area, the building, the campus, and the culture
of the user organization. Following is a brief description of
potential content within the mass notification event questions:
(1) What is the type of emergency event — that is, is it fire,
security, safety, health, environmental, geological, mete‐
orological, utility service disruption, or another type of
event?
(2) What is the urgency of the emergency event — that is,
does it represent immediate danger, has it already occur‐
red, is it expected to occur soon, is it expected to occur in
the future, or is its occurrence unknown?
(3) What is the anticipated or expected severity of the emer‐
gency event that is, how will it impact our facility and its
functions, is it expected to be extreme, severe, etc.?
(4) What is the certainty of the emergency event that is, is it
happening now, is it very likely to occur, is it likely to
occur, is it possible that it will occur in the future, is it
unlikely to occur, or is its occurrence unknown?
(5) What is the location of the event, or from what direction
is the emergency event approaching — that is, has it or
will it be approaching from the north, south, east, or
west?
(6) What zone or areas should receive the emergency
message(s) — that is, is it a floor of a building, multiple
floors of a building, the entire building, multiple build‐
ings, a campus of buildings, an entire town or city, an
entire state, an entire region of states, or an entire coun‐
try?
(7) What is the validity of the emergency event — that is, has
the emergency event been investigated and/or
confirmed?
(8) What instructions should we send to our personnel —
that is, should they evacuate the facility, should they
shelter-in-place, should they shelter-in-place at a special
location, should they proceed to a safe haven area, and
other action oriented items?
(9) Are there any special instructions, procedures, or special
tasks that we need to remind personnel about or to
accomplish — that is, close your office door, open your
office door, stay away from windows, do not use elevators,
and other information relating to personnel actions?
The questions suggested in items (1) through (9) are
offered for consideration, and not all of them might be appro‐
priate for every mass notification system installation. It is
important to remember that when an emergency event occurs,
the response must be immediate and deliberate. Therefore,
there is no time for indecision. So the questions selected to
reside in the emergency messaging decision tree illustrated in
items (1) through (9) must be straightforward and as simple as
possible. They must also be tailored to the specific organiza‐
tion, culture, site, and unique requirements of each local envi‐
ronment.
A.24.3.13   The emergency response plan should include, but
not be limited to, the following elements:
(1) Emergency response team structure
(2) Emergency response procedures, as follows:
(a) Building system related emergencies
(b) Human-related emergencies
(c) Terrorism-related emergencies
(d) Weather-related emergencies
(3) Emergency response equipment and operations
(4) Emergency response notification, as follows:
(a) Emergency message content
(b) Emergency notification approval process
(c) Emergency notification initiation process
(5) Emergency response training and drills, as follows:
(a) Classroom training
(b) Table-top training
(c) Live drills

performance-based pathway survivability approach. As with
most performance-based approaches, documentation should

be provided by the designer and maintained with system docu‐
mentation for the life of the system. Written documentation of
the approval from the authority having jurisdiction should also
be maintained. A performance-based approach to pathway
survivability could be equivalent to, less stringent than, or more
stringent than the prescriptive approach in 24.3.14. Often a
performance-based approach will result from a risk analysis.
This section is also not meant to preclude less stringent path‐
way survivability requirements supported by a risk analysis for
those unique occupancies that employ emergency voice alarm/
emergency communication systems for relocation or partial
evacuation as part of their fire safety plan where relocation or
partial evacuation could be readily superseded by total evacua‐
tion and where buildings are of a type other than Type I or
Type II (222) construction where the pathway survivability
performance requirement does not need to be for two hours.
Examples include low-rise education and day-care occupancies,
nursing homes, ambulatory health care occupancies, hotel and
dormitory occupancies, and residential board and care occu‐
pancies.
Refer to Annex F for previous nomenclature and cross-
reference.
•
A.24.3.14.9   Although in some instances areas of refuge (areas
of rescue assistance) might be installed in buildings that use
general evacuation and not relocation/partial evacuation, it is
still crucial that people awaiting assistance can communicate
with emergency responders to facilitate their evacuation. Thus,
their evacuation time might be prolonged, and therefore the
emergency communications systems should be capable of oper‐
ating reliably during a fire incident.
A.24.4   Where used, recorded voice messages for fire emer‐
gency alarm systems should be prepared in accordance with
this Code by persons who are experienced with the operation
of building fire emergency alarm systems and are knowledgea‐
ble of the building’s construction, layout, and fire protection
plan, including evacuation procedures. The proposed voice
messages should be approved by the authority having jurisdic‐
tion prior to being implemented. Persons who record the
messages for fire emergency alarm systems should be able to
read and speak the language used for the message clearly,
concisely, and without an accent that would have an adverse
effect on intelligibility.
It is not the intention that in-building fire emergency voice/
alarm communications service be limited to English-speaking
populations. Emergency messages should be provided in the
language of the predominant building population. If there is a
possibility of isolated groups that do not speak the predomi‐
nant language, multilingual messages should be provided. It is
expected that small groups of transients unfamiliar with the
predominant language will be picked up in the traffic flow in
the event of an emergency and are not likely to be in an isola‐
ted situation.
A.24.4.2.2.2   Generally speaking, in a standard building config‐
uration with normal ceiling height [8 ft to 12 ft (2.4 m to
3.7 m)], normal ceiling construction (e.g., drop acoustical ceil‐
ing tiles), standard wall configurations, and finishes and carpe‐
ted floors, ceiling-mounted loudspeakers should be installed in
all normally occupiable spaces and in corridors spaced at a
maximum of twice the ceiling height or as determined by a
commercially available computer acoustical/ loudspeaker
modeling program. Where wall-mounted loudspeakers are
used, manufacturer recommendations should be reviewed
and/or computer modeling should be employed. One of the
goals of loudspeaker placement is to provide the shortest prac‐
tical distance from the source ( loudspeaker) to the recipient
(person hearing the signal). In many applications, a combina‐
tion of wall- and ceiling-mounted loudspeakers might be
required. The audibility and intelligibility of the loudspeakers
can be impacted by the tap/setting at which the loudspeaker is
connected and should meet the audibility requirements of the
Code while still having the message intelligible. Connecting to
a high setting to meet the audibility requirements of the Code
could distort the intelligibility of the signal.
In an ADS that is a non-acoustically challenging area, design‐
ing for audibility will typically result in an intelligible system
provided minimum loudspeaker guidelines are followed. Areas
typically considered to be non-acoustically challenging include
traditional office environments, hotel guest rooms, dwelling
units, and spaces with carpeting and furnishings.
Special attention must be given to acoustically challenging
ADSs. Such areas might incorporate appreciable hard surfaces
(e.g., glass, marble, tile, metal, etc) or appreciably high ceilings
(e.g., atriums, multiple ceiling heights). These conditions will
require more stringent design guidelines to ensure intelligibil‐
ity (e.g., a closer than normal loudspeaker spacing with lower
taps). This can help reduce the effect of excessive reverbera‐
tion and result in better intelligibility. In extreme cases there
could be areas where intelligibility is not attainable, but this
can be acceptable if there is an ADS within 30 ft (9.1 m) where
the intelligibility of the system is deemed adequate.
In an ADS where the ambient noise level exceeds 85 dB it is
acknowledged that intelligibility might not be attainable and an
alternate means of notification is required.
Design guidance is provided in the NEMA Standards Publi‐
cation SB 50-2008, Emergency Communications Audio Intelligibility
Applications Guide.
A.24.4.4.2   The intent of this low frequency tone is to accom‐
modate those with mild to severe hearing loss. See also 18.4.6,
A.18.4.6.1, and A.29.5.10.2. The effective date listed in Chap‐
ter 18 for using a low frequency signal has not been allowed in
24.4.4 because voice systems are easily adapted to comply,
whereas the requirements of 18.4.6 also apply to stand-alone
tone signaling appliances.
A.24.4.4.3   Sleeping accommodations are provided in occu‐
pancies such as healthcare, detention and correction, and
other occupancies where it would not be necessary to utilize a
low frequency tone that awakens those sleeping. For example,
in a hospital, the voice message is used to notify staff members
who are already awake. The staff will then respond to the
appropriate location in the hospital to carry out their duties
that could include awakening and relocating patients who
could be in danger. In addition, fire drills are required to be
conducted on a regular basis and providing a low frequency
tone could unnecessarily awaken patients, which would be
detrimental to their care.
A.24.4.5.1   The choice of the location(s) for the in-building
fire emergency voice/alarm communications control equip‐
ment should also take into consideration the ability of the fire
alarm system to operate and function during any probable
single event. Although NFPA 72 does not regulate either build‐
ing construction or contents, system designers should consider

the potential for an event that could damage the equipment,
including remotely located control devices, to disable the
system or a portion thereof. Where practical, it is prudent to
minimize unnecessary fire exposures of fire alarm control
equipment through the use of fire-rated construction or enclo‐
sures, by limiting adjacent combustibles and ignition sources,
or other appropriate means.
A.24.4.6.1   Loudspeakers located in the vicinity of the in-
building fire emergency voice/alarm communications control
equipment or MNS equipment should be arranged so they do
not cause audio feedback when the system microphone is used.
Loudspeakers installed in the area of two-way telephone
stations should be arranged so that the sound pressure level
emitted does not preclude the effective use of the two-way tele‐
phone system. Circuits for loudspeakers and telephones should
be separated, shielded, or otherwise arranged to prevent audio
cross-talk between circuits.
A.24.4.7.1   Special suppression systems that are delivered
through a total flooding or localized application include, but
are not limited to, carbon dioxide, clean agents, halons, and
other extinguishing agents. Special suppression systems require
audible and visual warning alarms to provide personnel the
opportunity to evacuate or to alert personnel not to enter the
area of discharge that could be hazardous to life. A special
suppression system discharge can be a life-threatening hazard
for personnel who are not notified and, therefore, fail to react
to the pre-discharge alarm. In such cases, pre-discharge and
discharge alarms should be independent of the fire alarm loud‐
speakers that are used as part of the mass notification system. A
special suppression system discharge could pose a greater
threat to personnel that are located in the protected area, or
that could enter the protected area, if the local signals were to
be overridden and they did not receive the appropriate warn‐
ing.
Δ A.24.4.8   When a fire or other emergency occurs in a building,
the usual goal is to evacuate the occupants or relocate them so
that they are not exposed to hazardous conditions. The excep‐
tion occurs in occupancies using stay-in-place/defend-in-place
(SIP/DIP) [1] strategies. It might also be necessary to alert and
provide information to trained staff responsible for assisting
evacuation or relocation. Figure A.24.4.8 shows several key
steps in a person’s reaction and decision-making process [2].
Occupants rarely panic in fire situations [3,4]. The behavior
that they adopt is based on the information they have, the
perceived threat, and the decisions they make. The entire deci‐
sion path is full of thought and decisions on the part of the
occupant, all of which take time before leading to the develop‐
ment of adaptive behavior. In hindsight, the actions of many
occupants in real fires are sometimes less than optimal.
However, their decisions might have been the best choices
given the information they had. Fire alarm systems that only
use audible tones and/or flashing visual notification appliances
impart only one bit of information: fire alarm. It has long been
recognized that environments having complex egress situations
or high hazard potentials require occupant notification systems
that provide more than one bit of information [5]. To reduce
the response time of the occupants and to effect the desired
behavior, the message should contain several key elements
[3,6].
The key elements include the following:
(1) Tell occupants what has happened and where
(2) Tell occupants what they should do
(3) Tell occupants why they should do it
There does not seem to be any research that has tested
actual message content to determine the best way to inform
occupants. The problem is that each building and each fire is
unique. Messaging is further complicated by the need to give
different information to different people, depending on their
location relative to the fire, their training, and their physical/
mental capabilities.
Messages should use positive language and avoid negative
instructions that could be misinterpreted due to unintelligible
communications. For example, if you want people to leave an
area, say so: “A fire has been reported in the area. For your
safety, use the stairs to evacuate the area immediately.” A bad
example is: “The signal tone you have just heard indicated a
report of an emergency. If your floor evacuation signal sounds
after this message, do not use the elevator, walk to the nearest
stairway and leave the floor. While the report is being verified,
occupants on other floors should await further instructions.”
This message is too long, ambiguous, and subject to misunder‐
standing if not heard clearly. The word “not” might not be
heard clearly, or it might be heard to apply to the entire
remaining sentence. Similarly, care should be used in selecting
and clearly enunciating words such as “fifth” and “sixth,” which
can sound the same if the system and environment lead to low
intelligibility.
See A.24.3.6.1 for more information on methodology for
improved message content, structure, and intelligibility. Refer
to Annex D for more information on speech intelligibility and
how it is predicted.
Content of the message should be predicated on the emer‐
gency response plan, the nature of the building and its occu‐
pants, the design of the fire alarm system, and testing of the
occupant reaction to the message. Caution is advised that the
fire alarm system operation and message actuation might be
initiated by a manual pull station or detector remote from the
fire.

ered acceptable to provide a level of survivability consistent
with the intent of this requirement:
(1) Routing notification appliance circuits separately
(2) Using short-circuit, fault-tolerant signaling line circuits
for controlling evacuation signals
The requirement for notification appliances to operate in
those signaling zones that are not attacked by fire will also
require that circuits and equipment that are common to more
than one signaling zone be designed and installed such that
the fire will not disable them. For instance, a signaling line
circuit used to control notification appliances in multiple
signaling zones should be properly designed and installed so
that one fire would not impair the signaling line circuit,
rendering the notification appliances serving more than one
signaling zone inoperative.
A.24.4.8.6.3   Paragraph 24.4.8.6.3 requires the protection of
circuits as they pass through fire areas other than the one
served. The purpose of this is to delay possible damage to the
circuits from fires in areas other than those served by the
circuits and to increase the likelihood that circuits serving areas
remote from the original fire will have the opportunity to be
actuated and serve their purpose. Note that the protection
requirement would also apply to a signaling line circuit that
extends from a master fire alarm control unit to another
remote fire alarm control unit where notification appliance
circuits might originate.
A.24.4.9.1   Paragraph 24.4.9.1 does not prohibit the provision
of multiple notification appliance circuits within a notification
zone.
A.24.5   This section covers the application, installation, loca‐
tion, performance, and maintenance of mass notification
systems used for emergency purposes.
An in-building mass notification system is considered to be a
system used to provide information and instructions to people
in a building(s) or other space using intelligible voice commu‐

nications and including visual signals, text, graphics, tactile, or
other communication methods.
Mass notification systems can consist of fully independent
systems with minimal or no interface with the building fire
alarm system, systems that report trouble and supervisory
signals through the fire alarm system, systems that share audi‐
ble and visual notification circuits and appliances with the fire
alarm system, or combination mass notification and fire alarm
systems.
A.24.5.1   Although some minimum criteria are outlined for a
particular feature, the feature might not be applicable for every
project.
The information and instructions delivered by a mass notifi‐
cation system could be initiated manually by an operator or
automatically by sensors or other systems and might be deliv‐
ered to the target audience using prerecorded messages or live
messages, or both, tailored to the situation and the audience.
Each mass notification system could be different, depending
on the anticipated threat and the level of protection intended.
As an example, a particular project might not require secure
radio transmissions. As such, criteria for such would not apply.
However, if the authority having jurisdiction or design profes‐
sional has specified secure radio transmissions, the minimum
applicable criteria within this document would be required.
Deviation from these minimum criteria would require approval
of the stakeholders.
Mass notification systems can consist of fully independent
systems with minimal or no interface with the building fire
alarm system, systems that report trouble and supervisory
signals through the fire alarm system, systems that share audi‐
ble and visual notification circuits and appliances with the fire
alarm system, or combination mass notification and fire alarm
systems.
A.24.5.1.2(6)   Other systems could include wide-area mass
notification, distributed recipient mass notification, and
regional and national alerting.
A.24.5.2.1   Authorized personnel could include building occu‐
pants who can readily access and originate messages in emer‐
gency situations. Depending on the individual facility, use of
the mass notification system to originate non-emergency
messages could also be permitted. The selection of authorized
personnel should be based on a risk assessment and the build‐
ing emergency response plan.
A.24.5.2.2   Authorized personnel could initiate message signal‐
ing over the mass notification system from either an emergency
command center or a secondary (backup) control station(s).
In cases where clusters of facilities within the same geographi‐
cal region exist, one or more regional control stations could
initiate message signaling. The mass notification system could
permit activation of messages originated by mobile sentries and
roving patrols using wireless activation devices. Since it is
common practice to allow mass notification systems to be
utilized for “nonemergency” messages, the emergency
command center should incorporate a clearly marked and easy
to operate means to distinguish between emergency and none‐
mergency use. Comprehensive training and a fail-safe default
to the emergency mode of operation should be employed to
ensure that no actual emergency message gets transmitted as a
nonemergency broadcast.

A.24.5.2.3   As a general practice, the number of message selec‐
tion switches included as part of the operating controls should
be limited, so that authorized personnel can utilize the system
with only minimal familiarity. This, of course, could be a differ‐
ent matter on an industrial or college campus where trained
individuals are likely to be very familiar with the operation and
use of the system. In that case, more selection switches could be
beneficial.
A.24.5.2.5   It is recognized that there can be benefit for users
at the ACU to identify which specific location is currently in
control. This can be indicated through visual means or
through an audible location code. This can be especially useful
for emergency responders utilizing the ACU to know which
remote location is in control. If incorporated into a system,
such features can be enabled or disabled by authorized person‐
nel or as directed through the risk analysis.
A.24.5.2.10   During emergencies, building occupants should
periodically receive an audible clue that the emergency notifi‐
cation given by the mass notification system is still in effect.
This also can help building occupants and emergency response
personnel recognize that the mass notification system is over‐
riding fire alarm notification appliances. The audible signal
could consist of a simple signal such as a chirp of sufficient
duration to be recognized by the usual building occupants and,
typically, by occupants who are not hearing disabled.
A.24.5.3.1   The mass notification system could permit activa‐
tion of messages originated by mobile sentries and roving
patrols using wireless activation devices.
A.24.5.3.4   Generally, each separate building should be provi‐
ded with a separate in-building mass notification system;
however, some facilities (such as a campus-type high school
with multiple separate buildings) might be more effectively
served by a single in-building mass notification system. Alter‐
nately, a risk analysis could determine that a wide-area mass
notification system provides the optimal capability for mass
notification.
A.24.5.4.1   Alternate methods that achieve the desired statisti‐
cal availability could be deemed acceptable in lieu of monitor‐
ing the integrity of circuits, signaling channels, or
communication pathways where consistent with the risk analy‐
sis and emergency response plan.
An example of an alternate method could include an attend‐
ant monitored system, which is a device or system intended to
be constantly operated and maintained by competent and
experienced personnel either locally or from a remote station.
ANSI/NEMA SB-40, Communications Systems for Life Safety in
Schools, references “operational integrity” in relation to systems
that are used regularly for routine purposes and suggests that
such systems would be statistically more available due to a lower
risk of falling into a state of disrepair. ANSI/NEMA SB-40 also
addresses system readiness in relation to constant use, and
recommends that, to the greatest extent possible, equipment
used in emergency communication should be used daily in
routine situations. Therefore, it is important to consider the
level to which a system is constantly operated and the level of
operator training when preparing a risk analysis. Based on the
occupancy of the premise, the risk analysis, and the emergency
response plan, the designer and authority having jurisdiction
can more easily determine whether it is appropriate for loud‐
speaker circuits to utilize alternate methods for equivalency.
Such a constantly operated system could be determined to
achieve a statistically significant availability to satisfy an author‐
ity having jurisdiction.
A.24.5.7   The risk analysis should identify what emergency
situations will take priority over the fire alarm evacuation
signal. Should a tornado warning for the area take priority over
an active fire in the building? Should a breach of security at the
campus entry gate take priority over an active fire in the build‐
ing? If a manual fire alarm pull box has been actuated, it might
be a terrorist action to have people leave the building and walk
into an exterior threat. In such a case, mass notification input
is intended to override the fire alarm evacuation signals to redi‐
rect the occupants based on the conditions.
A.24.5.9.2   Devices such as gas or chemical sensors and detec‐
tors, weather alert signals, or other such signals can be desira‐
ble to connect to the mass notification system to provide a
faster response to emergency conditions.
A.24.5.10   Refer to 24.5.2 for requirements related to opera‐
tion of the system by authorized personnel. It is recognized
that, based on the risk analysis, control equipment and circuits
could need different levels of protection for different facilities.
Access to the fire alarm/mass notification interface should be
consistent with the action outlined in the emergency response
plan. It could have been prior practice in some jurisdictions to
locate the fire alarm control unit in the main lobby of a facility.
However, it might not be appropriate to locate the mass notifi‐
cation system autonomous control unit within the lobby if the
general public would have access to deactivate mass notifica‐
tion system components. Based on the risk analysis, it could be
appropriate to locate the autonomous control unit within a
secured room while providing local operating consoles for use
by other authorized personnel.
A.24.5.12.1   Mass notification systems can include a system
local operating console(s) for authorized occupants to readily
access and originate messages in emergency and non-
emergency situations. The quantity and location(s) of an
LOC(s) should be determined by the risk analysis and the
facilities emergency response plan.
A.24.5.13.1   The following is an example scheme for message
prioritization, from highest (1) to lowest (5), for consideration
during the risk analysis:
(1) Live voice messages from personnel in the building
should be the highest priority. If systems provide control
locations that are usable by nonauthorized personnel,
these controls should be disabled or overridden during
emergency operations.
(2) Automatic fire alarm messages/other high priority
messages as determined by risk analysis criteria.
(3) External messages originated by a wide-area mass notifica‐
tion system.
(4) Message priority for emergency conditions such as severe
weather warnings, gas leaks, chemical spills, and other
hazardous conditions should be determined by risk analy‐
sis criteria and defined in the emergency response plan.
(5) Non-emergency messages, such as general announce‐
ments and time function signaling (work breaks, class
change, etc.), should have the lowest priority.
A.24.5.13.6(2)   Unless the risk analysis determines otherwise,
the fire alarm system should always be automatically returned
to normal functionality. If the fire alarm system is automatically
returned to normal functionality, the building emergency
response plan should state that no user intervention is

required. When manual intervention is required to return the
fire alarm system to normal, specific instructions should be in
place in the emergency response plan explaining how the fire
alarm system notification appliances should be reactivated.
These instructions should be located at the fire alarm and mass
notification control units. Individuals responsible for manually
returning the fire alarm system to normal should be properly
trained in the procedure.
A.24.5.14   Control functions need to be accessible for those
intended to use them. This requirement is not intended to
require that the control enclosure be within the dimensions,
but rather the respective buttons, latches, microphone, and
other items the user will need to have within reach and view.
Figure A.24.5.14(a) applies when the horizontal reach is less
than 10 in. ( 254 mm).  Figure A.24.5.14(b) applies when the
horizontal reach is between 10 in. ( 254 mm) and 24 in.

A.24.5.18.2   The requirement of 24.5.18.2 does not imply that
multiple primary methods of visual appliances cannot exist in a
common area. Both visual notification appliance and graphical
or textual appliances are designated as primary where the
authority having jurisdiction declares both to be required.
When textual audible notification is required, consideration is
warranted for high-noise areas and for a person who is deaf or
hard of hearing being capable of clearly receiving instructions.
As mass notification systems are deployed, the more complex
emergency management communication requirements that go
beyond what can be indicated by a visual notification appliance
and a tone are being addressed. The intelligibility require‐
ments of an MNS/ECS are a direct reflection of this reality.
However, for a person who is deaf or hard of hearing, no
degree of intelligibility might be sufficient. Additionally, there
are physical spaces where intelligibility is impossible or imprac‐
tical to provide. In designating a primary visual notification
appliance, it is easy to assume that a visual notification appli‐
ance is sufficient and all other visual notification is automati‐
cally supplemental.

However, where the risk analysis and an emergency response
plan require the communication of MNS textual audible
instructions for occupants, a visual notification appliance
should not be considered a sufficient primary notification
appliance where intelligibility cannot be achieved or where
consideration for lone individuals or groups of individuals who
are deaf or hard of hearing might prevent them from respond‐
ing appropriately to emergency instructions.
A.24.5.20   The video display can be a video appliance used to
facilitate mass notification. Information displayed could be
video, graphic, text, or audio. Information can be transmitted
over a video distribution network, MATV, or CATV system.
These messages can be standardized or customized for specific
applications or situations. Dynamic text elements can be
derived from secure data or updated in real time, either locally
or remotely. Messages can be controlled by authorities to
update and alter content with manual overrides from author‐
ized security, police, and so forth to ensure up-to-date and real-
time information. The same can be accomplished with remote
control from an emergency command center. Examples of
interfaces used for real-time control include USB, Ethernet,
RS-232, and GPI.
A.24.5.22.1.3   Where automatic transmission is required to a
supervising station, it should be performed in accordance with
the emergency response plan. The purpose for disabling or
overriding the fire alarm system notification appliances during
simultaneous fire and mass notification events is so that occu‐
pants will not receive conflicting messages and fail to respond
correctly. Fire alarm notification that should be overridden
during a mass notification system activation could include audi‐
ble notification appliances, visual notification appliances,
textual notification appliances, and video notification applian‐
ces.
A.24.5.22.3.1   As part of the risk analysis and emergency
response plan, consideration should be given to future inter‐
facing in-building mass notification systems with a wide-area
mass notification system if it does not presently exist. In-
building mass notification systems should be designed to allow
future interface with a wide-area mass notification system.
A.24.5.23.1   A combined system can include an autonomous
control unit and fire alarm control unit supplied from different
manufacturers or placed in separate equipment enclosures;
however, the autonomous control unit and fire alarm control
unit should be integrated in their controls and performance to
meet the requirements of this Code.
N A.24.5.24.2   When a professional-grade public address system,
an engineered sound reinforcement system, or a pro-audio
sound system does not meet all the performance requirements
of Chapter 24, it can still be evaluated and documented with a
risk analysis and permitted for use as an emergency communi‐
cations system with the approval of the authority having juris‐
diction. For example, consider a professional-grade public
address system that includes outdoor-class loudspeakers not
listed for fire. In the risk analysis, an argument could be made
that the system is allowable for use during a non-fire-related
evacuation of the structure, a lock-down or lock-out condition,
or a reverse evacuation.
Another example could be an attendant monitored system,
which is a device or system intended to be constantly operated
and maintained by competent and experienced personnel
either locally or from a remote station. Consider a professional-
grade public address system, an engineered sound reinforce‐
ment system, or a pro-audio sound system that has a history of
reliability, is used regularly by trained personnel, but does not
support the monitoring for integrity requirements of NFPA 72.
When coupled with appropriate equivalency information provi‐
ded within the risk analysis, such a system could be deemed
acceptable to an authority having jurisdiction for specific occu‐
pancies and uses.
The risk analysis should also consider the need for secon‐
dary power. Typically, public address systems, engineered sound
reinforcement systems, and pro-audio sound systems do not
include integrated secondary power. So, if the application
requires secondary power, it would usually need to be provided
through an alternate means such as backup generator or an
ESS. For an ESS in particular, care should be taken to deter‐
mine the required capacity to support a minimally acceptable
operational period. See Section 10.6, Power Supplies, which
highlights concerns and issues such as continuity, capacity, and
various options.
A.24.6   Wide-area mass notification systems are generally instal‐
led to provide real-time information to outdoor areas. These
systems are normally provided with, and operated from, two or
more emergency command centers. Communications between
emergency command centers and in-building mass notification
systems is provided. Communications between the emergency
command centers and regional or national command systems
could also be provided. Wide-area mass notification systems are
often those such as campus giant voice systems, military base
public address systems, civil defense warning systems, large
outdoor visual displays, and so forth.
A.24.6.2   A commonly used method of protecting against
unauthorized changes using multiple levels of password protec‐
tion can be described as follows (in ascending levels of access):
(1) Access Level 1 . Access by persons who have a general
responsibility for safety supervision, and who might be
expected to investigate and initially respond to an alarm
or trouble signal.
(2) Access Level 2 . Access by persons who have a specific
responsibility for safety, and who are trained to operate
the control unit.
(3) Access Level 3 . Access by persons who are trained and
authorized to take control over a given area of a site to
allow local paging, which might be different from that of
another area. Note: This might require a higher form of
access to the local control.
(4) Access Level 4 . Access by persons that serve in a system
administrator capacity and are authorized to make
changes to the system and its associated software.
A.24.6.3   A wide-area mass notification system could have the
capability to communicate with other notification systems on
the site, such as the telephone alerting system, paging system,
cell phone, pager, PDA activation, e-Blast, message scrolling,
reverse 911, fax transmission, and highway advisory radio and
sign control system (used for dynamic control of radio informa‐
tion and traffic signs for emergency information and traffic
management).
A.24.6.5   High power loudspeaker arrays should be designed
with directional characteristics that will minimize the distortion
of voice signals by interface from other zones and will minimize
the transmission of voice or tone signals into environmentally
sensitive areas or off the site.

A.24.6.5.1(B)   Refer to Annex D for more information on
speech intelligibility and how it is predicted.
Normal weather conditions should be specified as appropri‐
ate for the geographic location.
In outdoor areas, such as in industrial areas with many multi-
story buildings, the maximum distance of personnel from an
outdoor loudspeaker often has to be significantly reduced to
retain acceptable intelligibility of the voice message. Loud‐
speakers that provide directional capability should be used.
These can be mounted on building exteriors if the loudspeak‐
ers do not radiate unacceptable levels of sound into the build‐
ing on which they are mounted.
At some sites, it could be necessary to control the amount of
sound that propagates in undesirable directions, such as into
civilian communities adjacent to the site boundaries or into
wildlife areas with protected or endangered animal species.
Additionally, in some areas, it might be necessary to mount
wide-area mass notification loudspeakers on the side of a build‐
ing while simultaneously preventing an unacceptable increase
in that building’s interior noise levels.
A.24.6.5.4   At a minimum, the high power loudspeaker array
controller should be located above known high water level
during historic floods. In northern states, the high power loud‐
speaker array should be located above known snow levels.
When selecting high power loudspeaker arrays, care should be
taken to ensure the equipment is rated to operate between the
high and low temperature range and other anticipated envi‐
ronmental conditions for the geographical location of installa‐
tion. The system designer should inquire about this
information as part of the risk analysis.
A.24.6.7.2   High power loudspeaker arrays should be mounted
not to exceed the OSHA and FEMA Publication CPG-17 ,
Outdoor Warning Systems Guide , for occupational noise exposure
limits or an absolute limit of 123 C-weighted decibels (dBC) as
referenced in FEMA to anyone in the immediate vicinity of the
appliances.
A.24.6.9   High power loudspeaker arrays and their supporting
structures should have a minimum design wind speed of
100 miles/hr [161 km/hr (86.8 kn)]. The supporting structure
should be sized to accommodate the static and dynamic loads
produced by the sound systems and all attachments. Seismic
loads are generally site specific.
Δ A.24.7   Distributed recipient mass notification systems are
enterprise-class systems for the management of, and mass distri‐
bution of, emergency notification messages within buildings,
throughout installations, across entire geographical regions, or
throughout a worldwide military command. Using distributed
recipient mass notification systems, designated system opera‐
tors would be able to rapidly and reliably inform appropriate
personnel of homeland security levels (including chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear threats; hazardous weather
conditions; and many other critical events), possibly with near
real-time response capability.
A distributed recipient mass notification system is meant to
communicate to a wide range of targeted individuals and
groups. These systems might use mass dialing systems, includ‐
ing reverse 911, email, SMS, or other directed communications
methods to broadcast information. They might also use wired
or wireless networks for one- or two-way communications
and/or control between a building or area and an emergency
services organization (information, command, and control).
Although classified as one-way ECS, distributed recipient
mass notification systems could be capable of centrally track‐
ing, in real time, all alerting activities for each individual recipi‐
ent, including sending, receiving, and responding to alerts, and
be able to generate reports based on tracked information.
Distributed recipient mass notification systems could be able to
provide ability to collect and report user responses to alerts,
such as "I am safe," "I need assistance," and "I am not in affec‐
ted area."
Distributed recipient mass notification systems could incor‐
porate a predefined library of signals and messaging appropri‐
ate for, but not limited to, the following:
(1) Presidential alert message
(2) Homeland security levels
(3) Terrorism threats, watches, or warnings
(4) Evacuation routes
(5) Emergency directives
(6) Personnel recall requirements
(7) Federal, DOD, police, fire, local, or installation-specific
warning and notification requirements
(8) Amber alerts
The distributed recipient mass notification system could be
capable of monitoring emergency notifications from multiple
data sources [ such as Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA ),
National Weather Service, Emergency Managers Weather Infor‐
mation Network (EMWIN), Naval Meteorology and Oceanogra‐
phy (METOC), and others as determined locally] and
automatically sending out notifications to designated facilities
and personnel based on predefined rules.
A mass notification system could also be capable of reaching
out to all online personnel by leveraging a highly secure,
redundant, Web-based IP network architecture to manage the
entire mass notification process. Agencies and organizations
can create role-based uses such as operators, administrators,
and recipients, based on their access rights across multiple
facilities, campuses, and installations. System rules could be
established to determine operator permissions and actions
such as creating and activating scenarios, as well as the extent
and geography of alerts and delivery systems and devices that
should be used. Such a Web-based mass notification system
would employ an open, standards-based architecture. The
system could be integrated with existing user directories to
support organizational hierarchy and emergency response
groups. It could be structured to allow emergency criteria–
based targeting of emergency alerts.
Additionally, this annex material provides information on
ongoing development of system requirements for net-centric
alerting systems (NCAS) that will be based on IP technologies.
This annex is not mandatory, but is provided to stimulate devel‐
opment of suitable requirements and standards. Consequently,
user suggestions and feedback on this annex are highly encour‐
aged and requested. Methods to ensure reliability and robust‐
ness in off-normal or emergency conditions are of particular
concern. The required amount of and method for isolating
alerting functions from normal, non-alerting system functions
needs development.
NCAS leverage the IP network infrastructure to instantly
reach those personnel who have access to nearly any IP-
connected devices [such as pop-up alerts on personal comput‐

ers (PC), text messages to cellular telephones, electronic mail
messages, and voice messages to voiceover-IP (VoIP) tele‐
phones and PCs]. Additionally, NCAS could be used to actuate,
through a single user interface, other (IP based and non-IP
based) alerting systems, such as wide-area alerting systems and
traditional dial-up telephone alerting systems.
NCAS can be installed independently or at a central loca‐
tion. In a centrally managed NCAS configuration, personnel
and facilities in the regional operations center’s particular area
of coverage could be alerted instantly by events, either from
any individual installation, or centrally from the regional oper‐
ations center. Using management tools, designated operators
from each installation in the region could log in via a web
browser and have complete access to their own portion of the
NCAS. The regional operations center would retain the ability
to centrally monitor and manage all portions of the system,
including supervisory and trouble conditions of the different
system components and integrated components.
The NCAS would incorporate a Web-based management and
alert activation application through which all operators and
administrators could gain access to the system’s capabilities,
based on the users’ permissions and the defined access policy.
Such a management application would incorporate manage‐
ment of the alert activation flow through all delivery methods,
as well as end-user management, operators’ permission and
access, tracking and reporting, and all administrative aspects of
the system.
Distributed recipient mass notification systems could inter‐
face and interoperate with other types of mass notification
capabilities, including wide-area and in-building mass notifica‐
tion systems. During emergencies, systems operators should not
need to send notifications using multiple alerting systems. The
distributed recipient mass notification system, particularly
NCAS, might be able to provide the capability to integrate user
interfaces and consolidate access to multiple mass notification
and alerting systems.
A.24.7.1   Distributed recipient mass notification systems could
enable the management of the notification flow, including
users’ management, groups targeting, operators’ permissions,
access policies, predefined emergency scenarios, and response
tracking and reporting.
A.24.7.2   Distributed recipient mass notification systems could
be capable of sending alert messages in a prioritized method to
target recipients according to the following:
(1) Hierarchical organizational structure (as would be impor‐
ted from an active directory)
(2) Organizational roles
(3) Specific distribution lists [e.g., hazardous materials
(HAZMAT) response teams]
(4) Specific distribution (e.g., person who is deaf or hard of
hearing or others with disabilities that warrant prioritized
notification)
(5) Dynamic groups created through on-the-fly queries of the
user directory
(6) Geographical locations (e.g., entire bases, zones within
bases)
(7) IP addresses (required for targeting devices in specific
physical locations)
Distributed recipient mass notification systems should
provide mechanisms to update user and targeting data(e.g.,
user data import, integration with personnel directories, and
self-user registration).
Distributed recipient mass notification systems could use a
Web-based user interface, support locally designated standard
network ports and protocols, and provide open interfaces to
support interoperability, such as eXtensible markup language
(XML) and common alerting protocol (CAP) based emer‐
gency messages. (See OASIS Standard CAP-V1.2, OASIS Common
Alerting Protocol version 1.2.)
•
A.24.7.5   Distributed recipient mass notification systems would
be capable of sending alert messages to end-users (recipients)
via multiple delivery methods, including the following:
(1) Audio-visual network alerts to desktops and laptops via
desktop pop-up
(2) Text alerts to mobile phones and pagers
(3) Text alerts to electronic mail (e-mail) clients
(4) Text alerts to social networks
(5) Audio alerts to phones
(6) Audio alerts to existing wide-area or building voice and or
mass notification systems
(7) Network alerts to any other IP-connected devices via
standard XML and CAP protocols
The system could be extendable to support additional deliv‐
ery methods in the future as this technology develops.
A.24.7.6   A distributed recipient mass notification system could
support multiple server and multiple site configurations to
achieve a “hot standby” failover configuration (i.e., no down
time in case of failure in a single server), as well as to support
higher load scenarios (e.g., more users). This could be accom‐
plished with premises-based systems or hosted configurations.
Backup configuration can either be a net-centric system
architecture located behind internet firewalls or hosted off-site,
outside the owner’s internet firewall utilizing a hosted software
and hardware configuration operated and maintained by
DRMNS provider(s), or incorporate features of both configura‐
tions.
A.24.8   Two-way, in-building emergency services communica‐
tions systems are used by fire fighters, police, and other emer‐
gency services personnel. This does not preclude equipment
outside of the protected premises.
A.24.8.6   Consideration should be given to the type of tele‐
phone handset that fire fighters use in areas where high ambi‐
ent noise levels exist or areas where high noise levels could
exist during a fire condition. Push-to-talk handsets, handsets
that contain directional microphones, or handsets that contain
other suitable noise-canceling features, can be used.
A.24.8.19   Two-way, in-building wired emergency services
communications systems are intended to provide emergency
service personnel and designated building occupants with a
supervised, reliable communication system that is completely
independent of other in-building communication systems. The
survivability of two-way, in-building wired emergency services
communications systems is paramount as they are intended for
use during and throughout the duration of a fire or other
emergency event. This kind of functionality requires that meas‐
ures are taken to ensure that the system is designed, installed,
and maintained in such a manner that they can survive and
function under extreme conditions.

NATIONAL FIRE ALARM AND SIGNALING CODE72-284
2019 Edition Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material.
A.24.10   Generally, an area of refuge (area of rescue assis‐
tance) two-way emergency communications system, a stairway
communications system, an elevator landing communications
system, and an occupant evacuation elevator lobby communica‐
tions system are all members of the same system type fulfilling
the same functions in different locations. These systems are
required to be installed in different buildings by applicable
building codes, and they are considered as life-safety emer‐
gency communication systems to be used by building occu‐
pants during fire and non-fire emergencies. Because they are
similar and all are two-way emergency communications systems,
it is appropriate that they are mandated by a common set of
requirements. These systems are different in nature from the
two emergency communications systems specified in
24.3.7.2(1) and 24.3.7.2(2) that are meant to be used by fire
fighters or other first responders or emergency personnel.
“Areas of refuge” or “areas of rescue assistance” are areas
that have direct access to an exit, where people who are unable
to use stairs can remain temporarily in safety to await further
instructions or assistance during emergency evacuation or
other emergency situations. It is, therefore, important that a
method to communicate exists between that remote location
and a constantly attended location either within the building
or at an off-site remote location where appropriate action for
assistance can be initiated by trained personnel.
Stairway communications systems are typically provided in
high-rise buildings between the fire command center and
remote points located at not less than every fifth floor in stair‐
ways where the stairway doors are locked from the stair side to
prevent building re-entry. It is important that a method to
communicate exists between that remote location in the stairs
and a constantly attended location either within the building
or at an off-site remote location so that appropriate action for
assistance can be initiated.
Elevator car communications systems should not be
confused with an elevator landing communications system, or
an occupant evacuation elevator lobby communications
system.  The elevator car two-way communications system is
installed in accordance with the requirements of ASME
A17.1/CSA B44, Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators .  Inspec‐
tion and testing of elevator car two-way communications
systems is performed in accordance with ASME A17.2, Guide for
Inspection of Elevators, Escalators and Moving Walks.
•
N A.24.10.2   The remote communications stations are also
known as “call boxes.” The master control unit is the main
control unit for the system, which includes a visual display of
the specific remote communications station location(s). Large
systems with numerous remote communications stations might
also include additional (sub) control unit(s) that could expand
the overall capacity of the system. The secondary power supply
is required in case of a loss of the primary power supply.
N A.24.10.2.2   The central control point is typically the fire
command center in high-rise buildings or any other approved
location in low-rise or other buildings not provided with a fire
command center.
N A.24.10.2.3   Typically the fire command center is not occupied
during non-fire emergencies, and therefore the master control
unit should have dial-out capability to an off-site constantly
attended monitoring station. During fire emergencies, fire
fighters will be in the fire command center, and they will be
able to provide assistance and guidance to occupants in need.
Δ A.24.10.5   To ensure a timely response to a call for assistance,
the call is to be forwarded to an approved off-site constantly
attended location, such as a supervising station, 911 communi‐
cations center, or other monitoring location.  Typically, when
the person in need is able to communicate, it is expected that
the monitoring personnel can quickly establish the exact loca‐
tion of the building and the location within the building the
call was made from and communicate this information to the
emergency responders. However, if the person initiating the
call is unable to provide the specific location within the build‐
ing (or unable to communicate at all), the appropriate emer‐
gency responders will be dispatched to the specific building
address. They should be able to locate the master control unit
at the building’s central control point and establish the exact
call location within the building on the master control unit
display.
•
N A.24.10.6   One method by which a signal is transmitted to the
off-site monitoring station utilizes telephone connections in
conjunction with caller ID to identify the phone number and a
name associated with the building. The call is initially identi‐
fied at the off-site monitoring location via caller ID information
(provided by the telephone service), a prerecorded message, or
other approved means, prior to initiating the two-way commu‐
nications. Information provided can be used to access a data‐
base of building addresses and other related information to aid
emergency responders attending the location. The intention of
this section is to ensure that off-site monitoring personnel have
instant access to the building address so that emergency
responders can be immediately dispatched to the correct loca‐
tion.
N A.24.10.7   Generally, the building code, specification engineer,
or system designer will identify the proposed locations of the
remote communications stations, as well as the master control
unit. These locations should be submitted for approval by the
authority having jurisdiction based on Chapter 7 requirements.
Requirements found in Section 24.10 should be coordinated
with the requirements of the building code in force.
N A.24.10.11   Generally, an area of refuge (area of rescue assis‐
tance) two-way emergency communications system, a stairway
communications system, an elevator landing communications
system, and an occupant evacuation elevator lobby communica‐
tions system are members of the same type of system.  Since it is
common to install these different systems in the same building,
there is no prohibition against any combination of these
systems being installed in a common building as a single
combination system with a single master control unit and
remotely located communications stations.  
A.24.11   An emergency communications system information,
command, and control is intended to include wired or wireless
networks for one- or two-way communications and/or control
between a building or area and an emergency command center
and could include an emergency services organization or
public alarm reporting system. In a very basic configuration, a
system and the receiving facility could be a supervising station
system. However, there can be more complex systems that allow
control of building systems and communications to building
occupants from a remote location, including a municipal or
other public alarm reporting command center or possibly even
from a mobile command vehicle using secure communications.
A.24.11.1   For the purposes of this chapter, an emergency
command center is considered to be a mass notification system
facility(s), with communications and control equipment serv‐

ing more than one building, where responsible authorities
receive information from premises sources or systems, or from
(higher level) regional or national sources or systems, and then
disseminate appropriate information to a building, multiple
buildings, outside campus areas, municipalities, or a combina‐
tion of these in accordance with the emergency response plan
established for the premises. A mass notification system could
include at least one emergency command center with optional
secondary/alternate emergency command centers.
A.24.11.1.1   The location of the emergency command center
should be coordinated with the first responders. The primary
emergency command center should be located at the
command post, emergency operations center, or some such
similar location. A redundant emergency command center, if
required, should be located at a physically separate location,
such as a police station, fire station, or similar facility.
Generally, the primary emergency command center should
be housed in a building or portion of a building separated
from the rest of the facility and having a 2-hour fire-resistive-
rated separation.
The mass notification system might require activation of
messages originated by mobile sentries and roving patrols using
wireless activation devices. In cases where clusters of facilities
within the same geographical region exist, one or more
regional control stations might also exercise control.
A.24.11.1.4   The emergency command center should be staf‐
fed by qualified personnel who would monitor the system and
take action appropriate to the emergency response plan estab‐
lished for the specific premises.
A.24.11.1.5   It is imperative that individuals expected to
initiate or deliver emergency messages be properly trained in
the expected operations. Individuals must be familiar with the
equipment, its location, and functions if they will be expected
to react properly in an emergency. In an emergency situation.
people only react according to instinct or habit. If the individ‐
ual has not had proper and repeated training over the emer‐
gency expectations, they could lack the proper instinct or
habit.
Reading an employee manual is generally not an effective
means of training for an emergency. To be effective, training
must be reinforced with multiple means such as text, audio,
visual, and, most importantly, hands-on experience. Regular
drills allowing for delivery of live messages indicating an emer‐
gency condition is important. Many people have a very difficult
time communicating clearly and effectively in an emergency
situation when they are excited or fearful. If live messages are
to be effective, they must be short, to the point, and in a calm
tone conveying exactly what is expected. Screaming into the
microphone, for instance, would not be appropriate. Actual
message content will depend on the emergency response plan
in place for the respective business and the response to an
unfolding event. Situations such as an intruder in a building
have become more common today and, as such, should be
considered and planned for.
A.24.11.3   Different messages or signals could be prerecorded
or live voice, tones, and so forth.
A.24.11.6   Text notification via wireless devices and desktop
computer notification could be an effective means for deliver‐
ing mass notification messages to multiple recipient groups.
Supplementary wireless text messaging could be effective in
reaching remote personnel. Desktop notification is particularly
effective when more complex information must be conveyed,
and it can be a cost-effective interim solution prior to, but not
in lieu of, installing an in-building mass notification system.
A.24.12   The risk analysis forms the basis for the emergency
response plan.
Ensuring accurate information dissemination to the right
people, at the right place, and at the right time is essential to
the mitigation of threat actions and consequences. Trained
personnel are charged with making such decisions in real time.
Quite often, the instructions provided to personnel in affected
areas pertain to acting in specific defensive ways so as not to
expose them to danger. A typical example is the case of a chem‐
ical or biological agent attack wherein the right response is to
relocate to secure areas within the building while sealing doors
and windows and shutting down air intakes, rather than to
leave the building and be exposed to the attacking agent.
In cases of bomb threats, where specific information is avail‐
able, directions for evacuation are to be given; these directions
require more specificity than simply the instruction “Evacuate
the building.” In most cases, the evacuation route might
depend on threat intelligence and is likely to be different from
that specified in an emergency response plan. Most people can
tell where the fire comes from but do not always know where
the bomb is. Automatic evacuation of a building, a common
procedure in cases of a fire, is to be avoided, since it might
expose personnel to even greater danger.
One of the reasons for implementing a mass notification
system is the threat of terrorism. Terrorism attacks tend to be
well organized and are often planned with details to inflict the
widest degree of damage that is possible. The mass notification
system must be designed to withstand various attack scenarios
and survive even if some damage has already occurred.
Each design of a mass notification system should be specific
to the nature and anticipated risks of each facility for which it is
designed. Although this chapter outlines some specific criteria
and/or limitations, each design should be based on recognized
performance-based design practices.
The mass notification system should take into account vari‐
ous considerations, such as those indicated in this chapter. The
particular design might or might not incorporate these provi‐
sions.
Considerations for developing a mass notification system are
as follows:
(1) Specific design for the facility
(2) Account for anticipated risks
(3) Use of live and/or prerecorded messaging
(4) Interfacing with other building emergency communica‐
tions systems
(5) Interfacing with wide-area notification systems
(6) Ability to control the HVAC and access control systems
(7) Access to system components
(8) Survivability of the system
(9) Communication link redundancy and security
(10) Redundancy and security of the emergency command
center
(11) Ability to customize and add to prerecorded message
library
(12) Messages should be tailored to the situation and audi‐
ence

(13) Scripted messages for live voice messages
(14) Proper training of individuals that operate the system
A.24.12.2   The design professional(s) as part of the design
team should be experienced in multiple areas considered
essential for conducting the risk analysis and performance
design based on the scope and size of the project. Areas of
experience can include, but are not limited to:
(1) Applying recognized performance-based design concepts,
(2) Conducting hazard and operability studies
(3) Technical aspects of fire alarm system design
(4) Technical aspects of emergency communication systems
(5) Security risks and/or terrorist threats
(6) Building code requirements and limitations with respect
to egress
(7) Human response to emergency conditions
(8) Development of emergency response plans
(9) Other qualifications relative to the needs of the user/risk
The design professional(s) will often be a part of the engi‐
neering design team preparing project documents and specifi‐
cations. However, the design professional can work for or be
obtained by a qualified installation company. The design
professional should be bound by professional licensing guide‐
lines to ensure that the risk analysis is conducted in an objec‐
tive manner based on user needs and not based on product or
employment.
A.24.12.6.3   Communication and coordination between and
among the various members of the design team is an important
element to achieving the goals for performance of the system.
Δ A.24.12.6.6   The SFPE Engineering Guide to Performance-Based Fire
Protection provides guidance on the elements of a design brief.
A.26.1   Table A.26.1 provides a tool for users of the Code to
easily and systematically look up requirements for protected
premises, central station service, remote supervising station,
and proprietary supervising station alarm systems.
A.26.1.1   Supervising station alarm systems include the equip‐
ment at the protected premises as well as the equipment at the
supervising station itself. While the operational requirements
relating to the signals sent off-premises fall under the scope of
Chapter 26, the requirements of Chapter 23 also apply. For
example, for protected premises fire alarm systems, refer to
Figure A.26.1.1.
A.26.2.1.2   The term immediately in this context is intended to
mean “without unreasonable delay.” Routine handling should
take a maximum of 90 seconds from receipt of an alarm signal.
N A.26.2.1.3(3)   Events can be general alarm signals or other fire
alarm signals not identified individually by point or zone.
A.26.2.2   The term immediately in this context is intended to
mean “without unreasonable delay.” Routine handling should
take a maximum of 90 seconds from receipt of an alarm signal
or at the end of the verification time by the supervising station
until the initiation of retransmission to the communications
center.
A.26.2.2(1)   It is recognized that individual fire departments
will have a preference on whether verification is used in certain
occupancies based on many variables such as department-
specific staffing or response protocols, occupancy staffing, and
occupancy risk. This section allows the fire authority to specifi‐
cally select those occupancies where verification is allowed. It
should be understood that the use of the alarm verification
process could delay the response to the alarm by up to an addi‐
tional 90 seconds.
A.26.2.2(4)   The 90-second allowance for a supervising station
to call the protected premise to verify the validity of the
received alarm signal is in addition to the time allowed for the
supervising station to initiate the retransmission to the commu‐
nications center.
A.26.2.2(6)   It is important to notify the communications
center that an alarm signal was verified and that fire conditions
exist at the protected premises or that some other type of an
emergency exists. Fire departments typically have a substan‐
tially larger response for confirmed structure fires.
A.26.2.2(7)   If an alarm signal cannot be reliably confirmed as
a nuisance alarm, then it should be immediately retransmitted.
This might include situations where no contact is made within
the premises, or where the persons within the premises cannot
verify the source of the alarm within the allowable 90 seconds,
or other related scenarios.
A.26.2.2(8)   When verification of a fire alarm signal results in a
signal not being reported to the communications center, it is
important that fire department personnel be made aware of
the alarm and the reason for nondispatch so that problematic
systems can be identified.
N A.26.2.4.1.3   If a carbon monoxide detector cannot be reset in
accordance with Chapter 14, it could indicate that carbon
monoxide is still present in the premises. Until such time that
carbon monoxide can be excluded as the source of the alarm,
the assumption should be that carbon monoxide is present and
appropriate life safety precautions should be followed.
A.26.2.5.2.2   Scheduled impairments include interruptions
caused by construction or building damage. In addition, natu‐
ral disasters can result in long-term system impairments that
are not intended to require 24-hour reminders.
A.26.2.7   Changing where signals go from an existing to a new
or different supervising station facility is sometimes done
simply by changing a call-forward phone number. Or, within a
supervising station, a new receiving computer and software can
be constructed and lines changed over. Often, the account data
are manually entered into the new system. Sometimes the data
are transferred electronically. Errors can be made, causing the
supervising station to get undefined alarms or incorrect
account data, resulting in incorrect response by the supervising
station. When such changes are made, the only viable way to
ensure correct operation is to conduct an end-to-end test.
A.26.2.7.1   The phrase “notified in writing” can include any
form of correspondence that can be verified upon request,
such as a letter, fax, email or other means of documented trans‐
fer of information from one entity to another.
A.26.3.2   There are related types of contract service that often
are provided from, or controlled by, a central station but that
are neither anticipated by, nor consistent with, the provisions
of 26.3.2. Although 26.3.2 does not preclude such arrange‐
ments, a central station company is expected to recognize,
provide for, and preserve the reliability, adequacy, and integrity
of those supervisory and alarm services intended to be in
accordance with the provisions of 26.3.2.

NATIONAL FIRE ALARM AND SIGNALING CODE72-290
2019 Edition Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material.
A.26.3.4   The terms certificated and placarded, which appeared
in previous editions of NFPA 72, were considered by some to be
too specific to two listing organizations and were replaced with
more generic wording. The concept of providing documenta‐
tion to indicate ongoing compliance of an installed system
continues to be reflected by the current language.
There are two distinct services offered by organizations that
list fire alarm service provided by prime contractors and central
stations. The first is the listing of these alarm services, which
requires the companies to demonstrate they have the knowl‐
edge and ability to install, test, service, and maintain central
station alarm systems and/or monitor and appropriately
retransmit on receipt of various signals from protected prem‐
ises alarm systems.
The second part of the service provided by listing organiza‐
tions is the certification of individual protected premises fire
alarm systems to bring the alarm systems under their ongoing
audit inspection program or systematic follow-up program.
Under this program, systems are certified by the listing organi‐
zation, and documentation of this is to be provided, posted,
and handled as described in 26.3.4 through 26.3.4.8. The
method used to document compliance with this portion of the
program varies among listing organizations and includes the
issuance of certificates, placards, or other documentation.
There is nothing in this Code that requires all protected
premises alarm systems monitored by a listed central station to
be tested, maintained, serviced, monitored, and responded to
in accordance with Section 26.3. This is often misunderstood
by code users, owners, and AHJs, who think that merely specify‐
ing that these systems be monitored by a central station with a
fire alarm listing gets them full central station service. Full
compliance with central station alarm system requirements
involves using alarm companies with fire alarm listings and
having the listing organization certify the protected premises
alarm system.
N A.26.3.4.1   The documentation in this section should not be
confused with the documentation required in Chapter 7, which
is typically provided by the alarm company and covers the
design, acceptance, and completion of new systems. Instead the
documentation in this section is provided by the listing organi‐
zation and could be in the form of a certificate, placard, or
other document used by the listing organization.
A.26.3.4.2(2)   The record of completion (see Chapter 10) can be
used to fulfill this requirement.
A.26.3.4.5   It is the prime contractor’s responsibility to remove
all compliance markings (certification markings or placards)
when a service contract goes into effect that conflicts in any way
with the requirements of 26.3.4.
A.26.3.4.6   The prime contractor should be aware of statutes,
public agency regulations, or certifications regarding alarm
systems that might be binding on the subscriber. The prime
contractor should identify for the subscriber which agencies
could be an authority having jurisdiction and, if possible, advise
the subscriber of any requirements or approvals being manda‐
ted by these agencies.
The subscriber has the responsibility for notifying the prime
contractor of those private organizations that are being desig‐
nated as an authority having jurisdiction. The subscriber also
has the responsibility to notify the prime contractor of changes
in the authority having jurisdiction, such as where there is a
change in insurance companies. Although the responsibility is
primarily the subscriber’s, the prime contractor should also
take responsibility for seeking out these private authority(ies)
having jurisdiction through the subscriber. The prime contrac‐
tor is responsible for maintaining current records on the
authority(ies) having jurisdiction for each protected premises.
The most prevalent public agency involved as an authority
having jurisdiction with regard to alarm systems is the local fire
department or fire prevention bureau. These are normally city
or county agencies with statutory authority, and their approval
of alarm system installations might be required. At the state
level, the fire marshal’s office is most likely to serve as the
public regulatory agency.
The most prevalent private organizations involved as authori‐
ties having jurisdiction are insurance companies. Others
include insurance rating bureaus, insurance brokers and
agents, and private consultants. It is important to note that
these organizations have no statutory authority and become
authorities having jurisdiction only when designated by the
subscriber.
With both public and private concerns to satisfy, it is not
uncommon to find multiple authorities having jurisdiction
involved with a particular protected premises. It is necessary to
identify all authorities having jurisdiction in order to obtain all
the necessary approvals for a central station alarm system instal‐
lation.
The phrase “in writing” can include any form of correspond‐
ence that can be verified upon request, such as a letter, fax,
email or other means of documented transfer of information
from one entity to another.
A.26.3.6.6   Two telephone lines (numbers) at the central
station connected to the public switched telephone network  or
a managed facilities-based voice network, each having its own
telephone instrument connected, and two telephone lines
(numbers) available at the communications center to which a
central station operator can retransmit an alarm meet the
intent of this requirement.
A.26.3.8.3.1(1)   Nothing in this section is intended to prevent
communication with the subscriber in less than 15 minutes
from the receipt of the signal.
A.26.3.8.3.3   It is anticipated that the central station will first
attempt to notify designated personnel at the protected prem‐
ises. When such notification cannot be made, it might be
appropriate to notify law enforcement or the fire department,
or both. For example, if a valve supervisory signal is received
where protected premises are not occupied, it is appropriate to
notify the police.
A.26.3.8.3.3(1)   The term immediately in this context is inten‐
ded to mean “without unreasonable delay.” Routine handling
should take a maximum of 4 minutes from receipt of a supervi‐
sory signal by the central station until the initiation of commu‐
nications with a person(s) designated by the subscriber.
A.26.3.8.3.4(1)   The term immediately in this context is inten‐
ded to mean “without unreasonable delay.” Routine handling
should take a maximum of 4 minutes from receipt of a trouble
signal by the central station until initiation of the investigation
by telephone.

Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material. 2019 Edition
A.26.3.8.3.5.3   The term immediately in this context is inten‐
ded to mean “without unreasonable delay.” Routine handling
should take a maximum of 4 minutes from receipt of a trouble
signal by the central station until initiation of the investigation
by telephone.
A.26.4.3.1   Consideration should be given to providing the
following features for a proprietary supervising station location:
(1) Fire resistive construction meeting the requirements of
adopted building codes
(2) Air handling systems isolated from common building
systems
As a useful guide for determining the nature of the design
and integrity necessary to achieve proper protection, the
proprietary supervising station building or that portion of a
building occupied by a proprietary supervising station should
compare the construction, fire protection, restricted access,
emergency lighting, and power facilities to the requirements
stated in the latest edition of ANSI/UL 827, Standard for Central-
Station Alarm Services.
A.26.4.3.6   It is the intent of this Code that the operator within
the proprietary supervising station should have a secure means
of immediately retransmitting any signal indicative of a fire to
the public fire department communications center. Automatic
retransmission using an approved method installed in accord‐
ance with Sections 26.3 through 26.5, and Chapter 27 is the
best method for proper retransmission. However, a manual
means can be permitted to be used, consisting of either a
manual connection following the requirements of Section 26.3,
Section 26.5, and Chapter 27, or, for proprietary supervising
stations serving only contiguous properties, a means in the
form of a municipal fire alarm box installed within 50 ft
(15.2 m) of the proprietary supervising station in accordance
with Chapter 27 can be permitted.
N A.26.4.4.1.3   Depending on a building's size and configura‐
tion, specific location information received by the proprietary
supervising station could be warranted. This information could
assist responding individuals by allowing them to respond
directly to areas of the building where signals have been initi‐
ated. An example of a building where this might be beneficial
might be a multi-floor building or one with a large building
footprint. Signals from smaller buildings, such as a fast food
restaurant or a gas station convenience store, would likely only
need to be general in nature. It should be noted that this
section does not specifically call for point identification, but
the specific device location information provided by such a
system would meet the requirements of the section.
A.26.4.4.3   Proprietary station procedures should include peri‐
odic review of nonrestored signals. One method for such a
review could be by the use of equipment that would automati‐
cally redisplay the information.
A.26.4.6.1.3.3   Regardless of the type of retransmission facility
used, telephone communications between the proprietary
supervising station and the fire department should be available
at all times and should not depend on a switchboard operator.
A.26.4.6.1.6.3(5)   The phrase “written notice” can include any
form of correspondence that can be verified upon request,
such as a letter, fax, email or other means of documented trans‐
fer of information from one entity to another.
A.26.5.2.2(1)   Chapter 14 permits the building owner or his
designated representative to perform these services if they are
qualified. In this situation, the documentation could be a
declaration of qualification signed by the building owner.
Multiple service providers are permitted.
A.26.5.3   As a minimum, the room or rooms containing the
remote supervising station equipment should have a 1-hour fire
rating, and the entire structure should be protected by an
alarm system complying with Chapter 23.
As a useful guide for determining the nature of the design
and integrity necessary to achieve proper protection, the
remote supervising station building or that portion of a build‐
ing occupied by a remote supervising station should compare
the construction, fire protection, restricted access, emergency
lighting, and power facilities to the requirements stated in the
latest edition of ANSI/UL 827, Standard for Central-Station Alarm
Services.
If the remote supervising station is located within an emer‐
gency response agency (ERA), the ERA should consider meet‐
ing the requirements of Chapter 4 of NFPA 1221.
A.26.5.3.1.4   A listed central station might be considered an
acceptable alternate location for receipt of fire alarm, supervi‐
sory, and trouble signals.
A.26.5.3.2   A listed central station might be considered an
acceptable alternate location for receipt of trouble signals.
A.26.6.1   Refer to Table A.26.6.1 for communications methods.
A.26.6.2.2   It is not the intent of Section 26.6 to limit the use of
listed equipment using alternate communications methods,
provided these methods demonstrate performance characteris‐
tics that are equal to or superior to those technologies descri‐
bed in Section 26.6. Such demonstration of equivalency is to be
evidenced by the equipment using the alternate communica‐
tions methods meeting all the requirements of Chapter 10,
including those that deal with such factors as reliability, moni‐
toring for integrity, and listing. It is further expected that suita‐
ble proposals stating the requirements for such technology will
be submitted for inclusion in subsequent editions of this Code.
A.26.6.2.3   The communications cloud is created by multiple
telephone lines and multiple paths on the Internet. Under
these circumstances, the requirements of Chapters 10 and 14,
as required by 26.1.2, do not apply to devices comprising the
communications cloud.FOR INDIVIDUAL USE ONLY

NATIONAL FIRE ALARM AND SIGNALING CODE72-294
2019 Edition Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material.
A.26.6.3   Certain legacy technologies (active multiplex, McCul‐
loh, directly connected non-coded and private microwave)
have been removed from the text of the document. Existing
systems utilizing these technologies are acceptable, because all
these technologies also comply with the general provisions of
26.6.3.
The object of 26.6.3 is not to give details of specific technolo‐
gies but rather give basic operating parameters of the transmis‐
sion supervision rates of technologies. The following list
represents examples of current technologies that can be config‐
ured to meet the requirements and the intent of 26.6.3:
(1) Transmitters using IP (Internet Protocol)
(2) IP transmission over the public open Internet or over
private IP facilities maintained by an organization for its
own use
(3) Transmitters using various (non-dialup) digital cellular
technology
Wired IP Transmission. There are two types of wired IP trans‐
mission devices. One where the IP network is connected
directly to the fire alarm control unit (integrated IP or native
IP). The second uses an intermediary module that can include
the following:
(1) IP dialer capture module
(2) IP data capture module (such as RS-232, keypad bus,
RS-485)
(3) Relay contact monitoring module
Devices referred to as “IP dialer capture modules” (an IP
communicator used with a DACT) are transmission devices that
connect to the DACT output of the fire alarm control unit and
convert the output data stream to IP (Internet protocol). As
such, they are considered to use IP technology in their connec‐
tion to the IP network. Therefore they should be treated in this
Code under the requirements of 26.6.3, performanced-based
technologies, and not under the requirements of 26.6.4, digital
alarm communicator systems.
Digital Cellular. To accommodate an increase in the demand
for mobile wireless communications as well as introducing new
services over that same network, wireless voice communications
no longer utilizes dedicated connections to pass voice band
frequencies. Current ubiquities methods such as 2G and 3G
have established a new and different environment to operate.
In place of the voice band, the voice conversation is converted
into a stream of bits and packaged within data packets that
conform to messaging protocols, packets are addressed to a
destination point, delivered into the network, received by the
destination point, and are converted back into an intelligible
voice-grade message. The message exchange through this wire‐
less data network is done through well known defined proto‐
cols such as “Global System for Mobile” communications
(GSM) for voice communications as well as Code Division
Multiple Access (CDMA) for both voice and data and General
Packet Radio Service (GPRS) mobile data services. These
protocols have been developed to operate in an optimal way
for the intended application. For example, GSM is used to effi‐
ciently establish voice-grade connections that deliver an appro‐
priate level of intelligible voice quality, but might not be good
enough to pass tones that represent data. Data transmission is
better served by GPRS and CDMA where a connection into the
wireless network is always available without having to “dial,”
and large amounts of data can be efficiently transmitted.
However the data passed using GPRS or CDMA is not that of
coded tones such as DTMF (Contact ID), but is computer type
messages similar to IP.
When using digital cellular, a DACT might or might not be
used.
For example, the digital cellular device might be used to
backup the DACT or, if properly supervised, be used as a stand-
alone device. If used, the DACT is connected to a digital cellu‐
lar radio device that connects to the cellular network by means
of an antenna. The digital cellular radio device is constantly
connecting to the wireless network and is always ready to
attempt to transmit to a destination address without having to
“dial” a number. The radio device recognizes that the alarm
panel is attempting to place a call by the DACT’s “off-hook”
signaling. The radio device accepts the DACT tone signaling,
converts it into a packeted data stream, and sends the packets
into the wireless network for delivery to a pre-assigned destina‐
tion address.
A.26.6.3.5   When considering a fire alarm system utilizing a
single communication path to the supervising station, consider‐
ation should be given to the risk exposure that results from the
loss of that path for any period of time and for any reason.
Some of these outages can be regular and predicable and
others transitory.
One example of a single technology used to produce two
paths is the use of a digital cellular premises unit communicat‐
ing with two or more cell towers. In this case, the supervising
station and the protected premises must be made aware if
communications degrades to below two towers. Another exam‐
ple is the use of two different cellular carriers to produce the
two paths. Similarly, in this case the supervising station and the
protected must be made aware if communications degrades to
one carrier.
A.26.6.3.12   Most communications equipment is not specifi‐
cally listed for fire alarm applications, but is listed in accord‐
ance with applicable product standard for general
communications equipment and is acceptable.
•
N A.26.6.3.13.1   Shared equipment owned by or under the
control of the subscriber should provide 24 hours of secondary
standby power.
N A.26.6.3.13.1.1   Shared equipment owned by or under the
control of an approved managed facilities-based voice network
provider should supply 8 hours of secondary power.
N A.26.6.3.13.1.2   The requirement in 26.6.3.13.1.2 does not
exempt first communications path transmitters and first
communications path shared equipment necessary for the
transmission of alarm, supervisory, trouble, and other signals
located at the protected premises from the secondary power
capacity requirements of 26.6.3.13. This section does not
permit the communications paths to be considered multiple
communication paths under 26.6.3.4.
A.26.6.4.1.1   Special care should be used when connecting a
DACT to a digital service such as DSL or ADSL. Filters or other
special equipment might be needed to communicate reliably.
A.26.6.4.1.3   To give the DACT the ability to disconnect an
incoming call to the protected premises, telephone service
should be of the type that provides for timed-release discon‐
nect. In some telephone systems (step-by-step offices), timed-
release disconnect is not provided.

Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material. 2019 Edition
A.26.6.4.1.3(C)   A DACT can be programmed to originate calls
to the DACR telephone lines (numbers) in any alternating
sequence. The sequence can consist of single or multiple calls
to one DACR telephone line (number), followed by transmis‐
sions on the alternate path or any combination thereof that is
consistent with the minimum/maximum attempt requirements
in 26.6.4.1.3(C).
A.26.6.4.1.4(B)(6)   Where two telephone lines (numbers) are
used, care should be taken to assign the primary DACT tele‐
phone line (number) to a nonessential telephone line
(number) at the protected premises so that the primary line
used in the premises is not unnecessarily interrupted.
A.26.6.4.1.5(4)   Where two telephone lines (numbers) are
used, care should be taken to assign the primary DACT tele‐
phone line (number) to a nonessential telephone line
(number) at the protected premises so that the primary line
used in the premises is not unnecessarily interrupted.
A.26.6.4.1.5(8)   Because call forwarding requires equipment at
a telephone company central office that could occasionally
interrupt the call forwarding feature, a signal should be initi‐
ated whereby the integrity of the forwarded telephone line
(number) that is being called by DACTs is verified every
4 hours. This can be accomplished by a single DACT, either in
service or used solely for verification, that automatically
initiates and completes a transmission sequence to its associ‐
ated DACR every 4 hours. A successful signal transmission
sequence of any other type within the same 4-hour period
should be considered sufficient to fulfill this requirement.
Call forwarding should not be confused with WATS or 800
service. The latter, differentiated from the former by dialing
the 800 prefix, is a dedicated service used mainly for its toll-free
feature; all calls are preprogrammed to terminate at a fixed
telephone line (number) or to a dedicated line.
A.26.6.4.2.2(A)   The timed-release disconnect considerations
as outlined in A.26.6.4.1.3 apply to the telephone lines
(numbers) connected to a DACR at the supervising station.
It might be necessary to consult with appropriate telephone
service personnel to ensure that numbers assigned to the
DACR can be individually accessed even where they are
connected in rotary (a hunt group).
A.26.6.4.2.2(D)   In determining system loading, Table
26.6.4.2.2(D) can be used, or it should be demonstrated that
there is a 90 percent probability of incoming line availability.
Table 26.6.4.2.2(D) is based on an average distribution of calls
and an average connected time of 30 seconds per message.
Therefore, where it is proposed to use Table 26.6.4.2.2(D) to
determine system loading, if any factors are disclosed that
could extend DACR connect time so as to increase the average
connect time, the alternate method of determining system
loading should be used. Higher (or possibly lower) loadings
might be appropriate in some applications.
(1) Some factors that could increase (or decrease) the
capacity of a hunt group are as follows:
(a) Shorter (or longer) average message transmission
time can influence hunt group capacity.
(b) The use of audio monitoring (listen-in) slow-scan
video or other similar equipment can significantly
increase the connected time for a signal and reduce
effective hunt group capacity.
(c) The clustering of active burglar alarm signals can
generate high peak loads at certain hours.
(d) Inappropriate scheduling of 6-hour test signals can
generate excessive peak loads.
(2) Demonstration of a 90 percent probability of incoming
line availability can be accomplished by the following in-
service monitoring of line activity:
(a) Incoming lines are assigned to telephone hunt
groups. When a DACT calls the main number of a
hunt group, it can connect to any currently availa‐
ble line in that hunt group.
(b) The receiver continuously monitors the “available”
status of each line. A line is available when it is wait‐
ing for an incoming call. A line is unavailable for
any of the following reasons:
i. Currently processing a call
ii. Line in trouble
iii. Audio monitoring (listen-in) in progress
iv. Any other condition that makes the line input
unable to accept calls
(c) The receiver monitors the “available” status of the
hunt group. A hunt group is available when any line
in it is available.
(d) A message is emitted by the receiver when a hunt
group is unavailable for more than 1 minute out of
10 minutes. This message references the hunt
group and the degree of overload.
A.26.6.5.1.4   The intent of the plurality of control sites is to
safeguard against damage caused by lightning and to minimize
the effect of interference on the receipt of signals. The control
sites can be co-located.
A.26.6.5.2   Originally the concept of one-way private radio was
codified for a one-way system requiring at least two receiving
towers or repeaters. Other similar systems have been developed
that use this basic principle. Among them is the concept of the
“mesh network” where a premises transmitter can access multi‐
ple nearby transmitters.
It is difficult to reliably test redundant paths on a mesh radio
network without significant impact on the system and consider‐
able efforts of time and personnel.
A remedy is to have the mesh network system equipment
generate a report at the protected premises or supervising
station showing redundant pathways. Additionally, the mesh
system equipment at the protected premises and at the super‐
vising station periodically determine the number of viable
redundant paths and generate a trouble signal whenever the
number falls below two paths, as is required by 26.6.5.2.
A.26.6.5.2.2   It is intended that each RAT communicate with
two or more independently located RARSRs. The location of
such RARSRs should be such that they do not share common
facilities.
NOTE: All probability calculations required for the purposes
of Chapter 17 should be made in accordance with established
communications procedures, should assume the maximum
channel loading parameters specified, and should further
assume that 25 RATs are actively in alarm and are being
received by each RARSR.
A.26.6.6.1   The signal information can be permitted to be
provided in coded form. Records can be permitted to be used
to interpret these codes.

2019 Edition Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material.
A.26.6.6.2(4)   Any signal that would dictate a different
response, such as carbon monoxide alarms or mass notification
alarms, should be individually identifiable so the appropriate
response to the event can be initiated. There are more types of
alarms and other signals that are being received at supervising
stations and that require different responses by supervising
station operators. These signals could be other than fire, but
still life safety in nature, and must be uniquely identified
because their signal is indicative of a different response.
A.26.6.6.3   An example of a critical assembly is an assembly in
which a malfunction prevents the receipt and interpretation of
signals by the supervising station operator.
N A.26.6.6.4   In order to expedite repairs, it is recommended
that spare modules, such as printed circuit boards, displays, or
printers, be stocked at the supervising station.
A.26.6.6.5   For all forms of transmission, the maximum time to
process an alarm signal should be 90 seconds. The maximum
time to process a supervisory signal should be 4 minutes. The
time to process an alarm or supervisory signal is defined as that
time measured from receipt of a signal until retransmission or
subscriber contact is initiated.
When the level of traffic in a supervising station system
reaches a magnitude such that delayed response is possible,
even if the loading tables or loading formulas of this Code are
not exceeded, it is envisioned that it will be necessary to
employ an enhanced method of processing.
For example, in a system where a single DACR instrument
provided with fire and burglar alarm service is connected to
multiple telephone lines, it is conceivable that, during certain
periods of the day, fire alarm signals could be delayed by the
security signaling traffic, such as opening and closing signals.
Such an enhanced system would perform as follows, upon
receipt of a signal:
(1) Automatically process the signals, differentiating between
those that require immediate response by supervising
station personnel and those that need only be logged
(2) Automatically provide relevant subscriber information to
assist supervising station personnel in their response
(3) Maintain a timed, unalterable log of the signals received
and the response of supervising station personnel to such
signals
A.27.1.7   Auxiliary alarm systems include the equipment at the
protected premises as well as the equipment connecting it to
the public emergency alarm reporting system. While the opera‐
tional requirements relating to the signals sent off-premises fall
under the scope of Chapter 27, the requirements of Chapter 23
also apply.
A.27.2.1   When choosing from available options to implement
a public emergency alarm reporting system, the operating
agency should consider which of the choices would facilitate
the maximum reliability of the system, where such a choice is
not cost prohibitive.
A.27.2.3   Consideration should be given to the fact that devices
could be installed in areas that are exposed to higher or lower
temperatures, moisture, or other environmental conditions
that could be more severe than ambient conditions found in a
typical building. As an example, equipment could be installed
inside a building in a boiler room, basement, attic, and so
forth, where temperatures actually exceed ambient conditions
outside the building. It is recommended that the authority
having jurisdiction consider all possible installation locations
and environmental conditions and that the equipment selected
be designed to operate within the most extreme conditions to
which it could be exposed.
A.27.4.3.3   Nonfederal radio frequencies are licensed by the
Federal Communications Commission. Federal radio frequen‐
cies are assigned by the NTIA. Most frequencies available for
FCC licensing require frequency coordination in order to limit
interference from other users. Authorities having jurisdiction
should use licensed, coordinated radio frequencies for wireless
networks in order to minimize interference.
Outside of the United States similar regulatory bodies
provide coordination and licensing such as Industry Canada.

A.27.5.3   Subsection 27.5.3 provides requirements for circum‐
stances in which a municipality or government agency has situ‐
ated a communications center at a location remote from the
alarm processing equipment for the public emergency alarm
reporting system. This might occur when the municipality or
government agency has moved the communications center to
combine services with other emergency dispatching, such as
police emergency and medical services, or to combine with
neighboring towns or cities (regionalization). In such cases, it
might be impractical to relocate the alarm processing equip‐
ment.

Δ A.27.6.1   There are three types of alarm boxes covered under
Chapter 27. They are the publicly accessible box, auxiliary box,
and master box.
(1) The publicly accessible box has a manual control that can
be operated by the public. This type of alarm box is typi‐
cally located outside on a pole or building and was previ‐
ously called a street box. The box type was renamed
because it is not necessarily located on or near a street.
(2) An auxiliary box is part of an auxiliary alarm system and
can be automatically activated either by initiating devices
in limited applications or by a protected premises alarm
system (Chapter 23). An auxiliary box can be located
inside or outside a building.
(3) The master box is a combination box that can be
manually operated (publicly accessible) and automatically
activated by the auxiliary alarm system (auxiliary box).
The master box is typically located outside on a pole or
building.

A.27.6.1.4   If the operating mechanism of a box creates suffi‐
cient sound to be heard by the user, the requirements are satis‐
fied.
A.27.6.2   Publicly accessible alarm boxes were commonly refer‐
red to as “street boxes” in previous editions of the Code. Appli‐
cations of these boxes are no longer limited to street locations.
A.27.6.2.1.6   Where the intent is for complete coverage, it
should not be necessary to travel in excess of one block or
500 ft (150 m) to reach a box. In residential areas, it should not
be necessary to travel in excess of two blocks or 800 ft (240 m)
to reach a box.
A.27.6.2.1.10   The current supply for designating lights at
boxes should be secured at lamp locations from the local elec‐
tric utility company.
Alternating-current power can be permitted to be superim‐
posed on metallic fire alarm circuits for supplying designating
lamps or for control or activation of equipment devices for fire
alarm or other emergency signals, provided that the following
conditions exist:
(1) Voltage between any wire and ground or between one
wire and any other wire of the system does not exceed
150 volts, and the total resultant current in any line
circuit does not exceed 1∕4 ampere.
(2) Components such as coupling capacitors, transformers,
chokes, or coils are rated for 600-volt working voltage and
have a breakdown voltage of at least twice the working
voltage plus 1000 volts.
(3) There is no interference with fire alarm service under any
conditions.

A.27.6.3.2.2.1(1)(a) and Figure A.27.6.3.2.2.1(1)(b)] is electrically
isolated from the public emergency alarm reporting system and
has its own power supply. The tripping of the transmitting
device does not depend on the current in the system. In a
wired circuit, receipt of the alarm by the communications
center when the circuit is accidentally opened depends on the
design of the transmitting device and the associated communi‐

cations center equipment (i.e., whether or not the system is
designed to receive alarms through manual or automatic
ground operational facilities). In a radio box–type system,
receipt of the alarm by the communications center depends on
the proper operation of the radio transmitting and receiving
equipment.
A.27.6.3.2.2.1(2)   The shunt-type system [see Figure
A.27.6.3.2.2.1(2)(a) and Figure A.27.6.3.2.2.1(2)(b)] is electrically
connected to, and is an integral part of, the public emergency
alarm reporting system. A ground fault on the auxiliary circuit
is a fault on the public emergency alarm reporting system
circuit, and an accidental opening of the auxiliary circuit sends
a needless (or false) alarm to the communications center. An
open circuit in the transmitting device trip coil is not indicated
either at the protected property or at the communications
center. Also, if an initiating device is operated, an alarm is not
transmitted, but an open circuit indication is given at the
communications center. If a public emergency alarm reporting
system circuit is open when a connected shunt-type system is
operated, the transmitting device does not trip until the public
emergency alarm reporting system circuit returns to normal, at
which time the alarm is transmitted, unless the auxiliary circuit
is first returned to a normal condition.
Additional design restrictions for shunt-type systems are
found in laws or ordinances.

A.27.6.6.2   The transmission of an actual emergency-related
message, initiated at the same time it is preselected for a test
message, and, in turn, preempts said test message, must satisfy
the intent of 27.6.6.2.
A.27.6.6.7   Examples of priority levels as follows:
(1) Priority 1 — fire
(2) Priority 2 — ECS
(3) Priority 3 — medical
(4) Priority 4 — supervisory
(5) Priority 5 — monitored for integrity signals
(6) Priority 6 — tamper
(7) Priority 7 — test
Additionally, within each signal category, additional priori‐
ties can be required such as Fire 1, Fire 2, Fire 3, and so forth.
A.27.7.1.6.2   There could be environmental conditions that
necessitate the use of rigid nonmetallic conduit.

A.29.1.1   Chapter 29 does not attempt to cover all equipment,
methods, and requirements that might be necessary or advanta‐
geous for the protection of lives and property from fire.
NFPA 72  is a “minimum code.” This chapter provides a
number of requirements related to single- and multiple-station
alarms and household fire alarm systems that are deemed to be
the practical and necessary minimum for average conditions at
the present state of the art.
Currently Available Smoke Alarm Technology.  The technologies
used in currently available smoke alarms include ionization
smoke detection and photoelectric detection. These detection
types are defined in 3.3.276.2 and 3.3.276.4 and are further
explained in A.3.3.276.2 and A.3.3.276.4. Ionization smoke
detection is more responsive to invisible particles produced by
most flaming fires. Photoelectric smoke detection is more
responsive to the visible particles produced by most smoldering
fire. Residential smoke alarms and commercial smoke detec‐
tors are currently available with either ionization technology or
photoelectric technology or a combination of both technolo‐
gies. The use of both technologies generally offers the advant‐
age of providing a faster response to both flaming and
smoldering fires, and is recommended for those who desire a
higher level of protection than the minimum requirements of
this Code.
Fatal home fires involving smoldering fires and flaming fires
occur at night and during the day. It is not possible to reliably
predict what type of fire will occur or at what hour of the day it
will occur. Therefore, the preference of one technology over
the other on the basis of the expectation of a particular type of
fire (predominately smoldering or flaming) is not a sound basis
for selection. While the current consensus of experts suggests
that neither technology offers an advantage when the fire type
is not known, there is a consensus that there would be a benefit
to having both technologies since the type of fire cannot be
predicted.
Based on recent analysis of the full scale fire tests documen‐
ted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in
Report TN 1455-1-2008, Performance of Home Smoke Alarms, Anal‐
ysis of the Response of Several Available Technologies in Residential
Fire Settings, the minimum provisions of the Code using either
technology are considered to provide an adequate level of
protection for most individuals who are not intimate with the
fire and are capable of self rescue. This would include occu‐
pants in the room of fire origin for both flaming and smolder‐
ing fires who escape through the normal path of egress.
Protection beyond the minimum provisions of the Code using
both technologies should be considered for situations involving
individuals who are not capable of self rescue or who might
need additional time for escape. These situations might
include families where extra time is needed to awaken or assist
others.
While it is true that ionization detection technology is more
susceptible to nuisance alarms due to cooking, the use of this
technology should not be dismissed, particularly where the
additional protection of both technologies is suggested. In
addition, there is no substantial evidence that suggests that
either technology is more susceptible to nuisance alarms from
bathroom steam. Provisions and guidance have been added to
29.11.3.4 to help minimize nuisance alarms from both sources.
This is important since smoke alarms that are disabled due to
frequent nuisance alarms offer no protection whatsoever. A
higher level of protection would be afforded by using both

technologies in all locations required by this Code with addi‐
tional locations in other rooms of the dwelling. In considering
this, pending the availability of smoke alarms specifically
designed for nuisance alarm immunity, additional locations
within 20 ft of a cooking appliance should be minimized, espe‐
cially for smoke alarms using ionization technology.
While these considerations reflect the consensus of experts
based on currently available test data that allows analysis of
tenability along with alarm response, full scale fire testing and
nuisance alarm testing of current technologies has continued
and analysis of this data will also continue. In addition, new
technologies are being considered with the prospect of
enhanced detection response along with a higher immunity to
nuisance activations. The work of the industry and the NFPA
technical committee responsible for smoke alarm provisions
will be ongoing.
A.29.1.2   An example of the applicable code within the NFPA
set of codes and standards is NFPA 101. Other codes such as
local building codes are other examples to be considered.
The requirements of Chapter 29 are intended to apply to
installations in the following new and existing locations:
(1) One- and two-family dwelling units
(2) Sleeping rooms of lodging and rooming houses
(3) Individual dwelling units of apartment buildings
(4) Guest rooms, sleeping rooms, and living areas within
guest suites of hotels and dormitories
(5) Day-care homes
(6) Residential board and care facilities
(7) Other locations where applicable laws , codes, or stand‐
ards specify a requirement for the installation of smoke
alarms
A.29.1.4   Installations in manufactured homes are under the
jurisdiction of The Department of Housing and Urban Devel‐
opment (HUD). The rules for installation are addressed in the
Federal Manufactured Housing Construction Safety Standards
(available at http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/mhs/
mhshome.cfm).
Δ A.29.2   Fire Danger in the Home.  In 2009, fire was the third lead‐
ing cause of unintentional injury deaths in the home and the
sixth leading cause of unintentional injury deaths overall
(Injury Facts, 2011, National Safety Council).
Seventy-nine percent of the fire fatalities in 2015 resulted
from residential fires — 82.7 percent resulted from fires in one-
and two-family dwellings, including manufactured homes;
15.5 percent were caused by apartment fires; and 1.7 percent
resulted from fires in other residential occupancies (“Fire Loss
in the United States during 2015,” Hylton J.G. Haynes, NFPA
Fire Analysis and Research Division).
Approximately half (52 percent) of the home (dwellings and
apartments) fire fatalities resulted from fires reported between
11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., the common sleeping hours (“Home
Structure Fires,” Marty Ahrens, NFPA Fire Analysis and
Research Division, September 2016).
Almost three-quarters ( 71 percent) of all reported fire inju‐
ries occurred in the home, with more than one-half
(73 percent) in one- and two-family dwelling units (including
manufactured housing), and more than one-fifth (27 percent)
apartments (“Fire Loss in the United States During 2015,”
Hylton J.G. Haynes, NFPA Fire Analysis and Research Division).
It is estimated that each household will experience five
(usually unreported) fires per lifetime and one in four fires
serious enough to report to a fire department per lifetime (“A
Few Facts at the Household Level,” NFPA Fire Analysis Division,
July 2009).
Fire Safety in the Home. NFPA 72 is intended to provide reason‐
able safety for persons in family living units. Reasonable fire
safety can be produced through the following three-point
program:
(1) Minimizing fire hazards
(2) Providing fire-warning equipment
(3) Having and practicing an escape plan
Minimizing Fire Hazards. This Code cannot protect all persons
at all times. For instance, the application of this Code might
not provide protection against the following three traditional
fatal fire scenarios:
(1) Smoking in bed
(2) Leaving children home alone
(3) Cleaning with flammable liquids such as gasoline
However, Chapter 29 can lead to reasonable safety from fire
when the three-point program is observed.
Fire-Warning Equipment. There are two types of fire to which
household fire-warning equipment needs to respond. One is a
rapidly developing, high-heat fire. The other is a slow, smolder‐
ing fire. Either can produce smoke and toxic gases.
Family Escape Plan. There is often very little time between the
detection of a fire and the time it becomes deadly. This interval
can be as little as 1 or 2 minutes. Thus, this Code requires
detection means to give a family some advance warning of the
development of conditions that become dangerous to life
within a short period of time. Such warning, however, could be
wasted unless the family has planned in advance for rapid exit
from their residence. Therefore, in addition to the fire-warning
equipment, this Code assumes that the residents have devel‐
oped and practiced an exit plan.
Planning and practicing for fire conditions with a focus on
rapid exit from the residence are important. Drills should be
held so that all family members know the action to be taken.
Each person should plan for the possibility that exit out of a
bedroom window could be necessary. An exit out of the resi‐
dence without the need to open a bedroom door is essential.
Household fires are especially dangerous at night when the
occupants are asleep. Fires produce smoke and deadly gases
that can overcome occupants while they are asleep. Further‐
more, dense smoke reduces visibility. Most fire casualties are
victims of smoke and gas inhalation rather than burns. To warn
against a fire, Chapter 29 provides smoke detector (alarm)
requirements in accordance with 29.8.1, and the associated
annex recommends heat or smoke detectors (alarms) in all
other major areas.
A.29.3.3   This Code establishes minimum standards for the use
of fire-warning equipment. The use of additional alarms or
detectors over and above the minimum standard is encour‐
aged. The use of additional devices can result in a combination
of equipment (e.g., a combination of single- and multiple-
station alarms or a combination of smoke alarms or smoke
detectors that are part of a security/fire system and existing
multiple-station alarms). Though a combination is allowed, one
type of equipment must independently meet the requirements

of the Code. Compliance with the requirements of the Code
cannot rely on the combination of the following fire-warning
equipment:
(1) Single-station alarms
(2) Multiple-station alarms
(3) Household fire alarm system (includes a security/fire
system with smoke alarms or smoke detectors)
It is encouraged that the highest level of protection be used
where possible. For example, if multiple-station alarms are
added to an occupancy with compliant single-station alarms,
the multiple-station alarms should be installed to replace all of
the single-station alarms. Similarly, if a monitored household
fire alarm system is added to a house that has compliant
multiple-station alarms, monitored smoke alarms or smoke
detectors should be installed to replace the multiple-station
alarms or be installed to provide the same required coverage.
The responsiveness of ionization- and photoelectric-type
smoke alarms depends on a number of factors, including the
type of fire (smoldering, flaming), the chemistry of materials
involved in the fire, and the properties of the resulting smoke.
Several fire safety organizations recommend that a consumer
utilize both ionization and photoelectric technologies in their
home smoke alarm systems to permit the longest potential
escape times for nonspecific fire situations. This will not
preclude the development of new technology with equivalent
performance.
Δ A.29.5.1   The use of the distinctive three-pulse temporal
pattern fire alarm evacuation signal has been recommended by
this Code since 1979. It has since been adopted as both an
American National Standard [ANSI/ASA S3.41, American
National Standard Audible Emergency Evacuation (E2) and Evacua‐
tion Signals with Relocation Instructions (ESRI) ] and an Interna‐
tional Standard (ISO 8201, Audible Emergency Evacuation Signal).
Copies of both of these standards are available from:
Standards Publication Fulfillment, P.O., Box 1020, Sewickly,
PA 15143-9998, Tel. 412-741-1979.
For information about the Acoustical Society of America, or
for how and why the three-pulse temporal pattern signal was
chosen as the international standard evacuation signal, contact
Standards Secretariat, Acoustical Society of America, 35 Pine‐
lawn Road, Suite 114E, Melville, NY 11747, Tel. 531-490-0215,
Email: asastds@aip.org.
The standard fire alarm evacuation signal is a three-pulse
temporal pattern using any appropriate sound. The pattern
consists of the following in this order:
(1) An “on” phase lasting 0.5 second ±10 percent.
(2) An “off” phase lasting 0.5 second ±10 percent for three
successive “on” periods.
(3) An “off” phase lasting 1.5 seconds ±10 percent [see Figure
A.29.5.1(a) and Figure A.29.5.1(b)] . The signal should be
repeated for a period appropriate for the purposes of
evacuation of the building, but for not less than
180 seconds. A single-stroke bell or chime sounded at
“on” intervals lasting 1 second ±10 percent, with a 2-
second ±10 percent “off” interval after each third “on”
stroke, is permitted [see Figure A.29.5.1(c)].
The minimum repetition time is permitted to be manually
interrupted.
N A.29.5.3   The four pulse temporal pattern is illustrated in
Figure A.29.5.3.
A.29.5.5   It is recommended that the voice notification
message be intelligible, audible, and appropriate for the
hazard. Care should be taken to avoid excessive silence during
the message. Figure A.29.5.5(a) through Figure A.29.5.5(c)
provide examples of acceptable combinations of the emer‐
gency evacuation signal and voice messages.
N A.29.5.6   Temporal pattern parameters with voice allowance
are shown in Figure A.29.5.6(a), Figure A.29.5.6(b), and Figure
A.29.5.6(c).
A.29.5.8   Low frequency or tactile notification appliances such
as bed shakers have been shown to be effective in waking those
with normal hearing to profound hearing loss [CSE NIH
report, 2005; Bruck and Thomas, 2009; Bruck, Thomas, and
Ball, NFPA RF report, 2007].
A.29.5.10.1   As an example, governing laws, codes, or stand‐
ards might require a certain number of accommodations be
equipped for those with hearing loss or other disability.
A.29.5.10.1(2)   It is not the intent of this section to preclude
devices that have been demonstrated through peer-reviewed
research to awaken occupants with hearing loss as effectively as
those using the frequency and amplitude specified in this
section.

A.29.5.10.2   Tactile notification appliances such as bed shakers
have been shown to be effective in waking those with normal
hearing to profound hearing loss [Ashley et al., 2005, UL 1971,
1991]. Tactile signaling has been studied and found to be an
effective way to alert and notify sleeping persons. However,
there are many variables that have not been tested that might
affect the reliability of their performance. Some of the appli‐
ance variables include the mass of the appliance, frequency of
vibration, and the throw or displacement of the vibrating mass.
Occupant variables that might affect the reporting of test
results and the effectiveness of the appliance include the
person’s age, how long a person has lived with their hearing
loss, and what sleep stage the person is experiencing when the
appliance operates. The type of mattress might also have an
effect of the performance of certain tactile appliances. Mattress
variables can include thickness, firmness, memory foam, pillow
tops, water beds, air beds, and motion isolation mattresses.
Users of tactile appliances should be cautioned to test how well
they might sense the effect of the appliance.
The Code requires both visual notification appliances and
tactile appliances. Visual notification appliances can awaken
sleeping persons, provide verification that there is a fire alarm
condition, and serve to alert persons when they are not in
contact with a tactile appliance.

A.29.6.1   Working smoke alarms cut the risk of dying in repor‐
ted home structure fires in half. Victims who are intimate with
the fire or are incapable of taking action to escape might not
benefit from the early warning. For these people, other strat‐
egies such as protection in-place or assisted escape or rescue
would be necessary.
A.29.6.2   Family Escape Plan.  There often is very little time
between the detection of a fire and the time it becomes deadly.
This interval can be as little as 1 or 2 minutes. Thus, this Code
requires detection means to give a family some advance warn‐
ing of the development of conditions that become dangerous
to life within a short period of time. Such warning, however,
could be wasted unless the family has planned in advance for
rapid exit from their residence. Therefore, in addition to the
fire-warning equipment, this Code requires exit plan informa‐
tion to be furnished.
Planning and practicing for fire conditions with a focus on
rapid exit from the residence are important. Drills should be
held so that all family members know the action to be taken.
Each person should plan for the possibility that exit out of a
bedroom window could be necessary. An exit out of the resi‐
dence without the need to open a bedroom door is essential.
Special Provisions for the Disabled.  For special circumstances
where the life safety of an occupant(s) depends on prompt
rescue by others, the fire-warning equipment should include
means of prompt automatic notification to those who are to be
depended on for rescue.
A.29.6.2.3   The normal path of egress does not include
windows or other means of escape.
A.29.6.3   Assumptions — equipment is as follows:
(1) Maintenance. Good fire protection requires that the
equipment be maintained periodically. If the system
owner or responsible party is unable to perform the
required maintenance, a maintenance agreement should
be considered.
(2) Reliability of fire alarm systems. Fire alarm systems loca‐
ted in dwelling units and having all of the following
features are considered to have a functional reliability of
95 percent:
(a) Utilizes a control unit
(b) Has at least two independent sources of operating
power
(c) Monitors all initiating and notification circuits for
integrity
(d) Transmits alarm signals to a constantly attended,
remote monitoring location
(e) Is tested regularly by the homeowner and at least
every 3 years by a qualified service technician
(3) Reliability of fire alarm systems without remote monitor‐
ing or with wireless transmission. Fire alarm systems for
dwelling units with all of the preceding features except
(d) or systems that use low-power wireless transmission
from initiating devices within the dwelling units are
considered to have a functional reliability of 90 percent.
(4) Reliability of other systems. Fire alarm systems for dwell‐
ing units comprised of interconnected smoke alarms
where the interconnecting means is monitored for integ‐
rity are considered to have a functional reliability of
88 percent. If the interconnecting means is not super‐
vised or the alarms are not interconnected, such systems
are considered to have a functional reliability of
85 percent.
N A.29.7   Hazardous concentrations of carbon monoxide can
accumulate in a residence, generally from improperly operat‐
ing heating appliances, insufficient make-up air into the resi‐
dence or space, or blocked chimneys or vents. However, there
are many other potential sources of carbon monoxide within a
home, including, but not limited to, the following:
(1) Malfunctioning fossil fuel–burning appliances
(2) Wood stoves
(3) Fireplaces
(4) Idling automobiles in attached garages
(5) Portable equipment such as gasoline-powered lawn and
garden equipment and electric power generators
(6) Barbecues
Carbon monoxide is odorless, tasteless, and colorless; there‐
fore, its presence is undetectable by smell, taste, or sight.
Carbon monoxide can be mixed and migrate throughout a
residence through the HVAC system. Carbon monoxide alarms
meeting the requirements of ANSI/UL 2034, Standard for Single
and Multiple Station Carbon Monoxide Alarms , carbon monoxide
detectors meeting the requirements of ANSI/UL 2075, Stand‐
ard for Safety Gas and Vapor Detectors and Sensors , and installed in
accordance with this standard should provide a significant level
of protection against fatal carbon monoxide exposure.
The installation of additional carbon monoxide alarms
could result in a higher degree of protection. Adding alarms to
rooms where fuel-burning appliances are located could provide
earlier warning of carbon monoxide hazards caused by those
sources. Additional alarms located in rooms normally closed off
from the required alarms could increase the escape time, since
the carbon monoxide concentration needed to force the
carbon monoxide out of the closed rooms to the alarms would
not be necessary. As a consequence, the installation of addi‐
tional carbon monoxide alarms should be considered.
Carbon monoxide alarms or detectors are not substitutes for
proper maintenance, inspection, and testing of fuel-burning
equipment. Fuel-burning equipment and appliances should be
used, maintained, tested, and inspected according to the
manufacturers’ instructions.
Carbon monoxide detectors/alarms are cross sensitive to
hydrogen, an explosive gas that can be given off by recharging
lead acid batteries. Where households include recharging
stations (e.g., for golf carts), the alarm should be located away
from the recharging location.
N A.29.7.1.1   Where sleeping areas are separated and the audibil‐
ity of the alarm or detector to occupants within each sleeping
area could be seriously impaired, more than one unit could be
needed.
At times, depending on conditions, the audibility of notifica‐
tion appliances could be seriously impaired when occupants
are in the bedroom area. For instance, there might be a noisy
window air conditioner or room humidifier generating an
ambient noise level of 55 dBA or higher. The detection device
alarms need to penetrate through the closed doors and be
heard over the bedroom's noise levels with sufficient intensity
to awaken sleeping occupants. Test data indicate that alarms
with ratings of 85 dBA at 3 m (10 ft) that are installed outside
the bedrooms can produce about 15 dBA over ambient noise

levels of 55 dBA in the bedrooms. This sound pressure is likely
to be sufficient to awaken the average sleeping person.
Alarms or detectors located remote from the bedroom area
might not be loud enough to awaken the average person. In
such cases, it is recommended that units be interconnected in
such a way that the operation of the remotely located detector
or alarm causes an alarm of sufficient intensity to penetrate the
bedrooms. The interconnection can be accomplished by the
following:
(1) Installation of a system
(2) Wiring together of multiple-station alarms
(3) Use of line carrier or radio frequency transmitters/receiv‐
ers
(4) Adding supplemental notification appliances
N A.29.7.1.2   The location for effective performance is not
generally dependent on mounting height. The density of
carbon monoxide is similar to that of air at room temperature,
and carbon monoxide generally mixes readily with air.
A.29.8.1   All hostile fires in dwelling units generate smoke and
heat. However, the results of full-scale experiments conducted
over the last several decades in the United States, using typical
fires in dwelling units, indicate that detectable quantities of
smoke precede detectable levels of heat in nearly all cases (NBS
GCR 75-51, Detector Sensitivity and Siting Requirements for Dwell‐
ings, 1975; NBS GCR 77-82, Detector Sensitivity and Siting Require‐
ments for Dwellings Phase 2 , 1977; and NIST Technical Note
1455-1, Performance of Home Smoke Detectors Analysis of the Response
of Several Available Technologies in a Residential Setting,  2007). In
addition, slowly developing, smoldering fires can produce
smoke and toxic gases without a significant increase in the
room’s temperature. Again, the results of experiments indicate
that detectable quantities of smoke precede the development
of hazardous thermal atmospheres in nearly all cases.
For the preceding reasons, the required protection in this
Code utilizes smoke alarms as the primary life safety equipment
for providing a reasonable level of protection against fire.
The installation of additional alarms of either the smoke or
heat type should result in a higher degree of protection.
Adding alarms to rooms that are normally closed off from the
required alarms increases the escape time because the fire does
not need to build to the higher level necessary to force smoke
out of the closed room to the required alarms. As a conse‐
quence, it is recommended that the householder consider the
installation of additional fire protection devices. However, it
should be understood that Chapter 29 does not require addi‐
tional smoke alarms over and above those called for in 29.8.1.
Refer to Figure A.29.8.1(a) through Figure A.29.8.1(d) where
required smoke alarms are shown.
Where to Locate the Required Smoke Alarms.  Fifty-three percent
of home fire deaths were reported between 11:00 p.m. and
7:00 a.m. Persons in sleeping areas can be threatened by fires
in the remainder of the unit; therefore, smoke alarms are best
located in each bedroom and between the bedroom areas and
the rest of the unit as shown in Figure A.29.8.1(b). In dwelling
units with more than one bedroom area or with bedrooms on
more than one floor, more than one smoke alarm is required,
as shown in Figure A.29.8.1(c).
In addition to smoke alarms outside of the sleeping areas
and in each bedroom, Chapter 29 requires the installation of a
smoke alarm on each additional level of the dwelling unit,
including the basement. These installations are shown in
Figure A.29.8.1(d). The living area smoke alarm should be
installed in the living room or near the stairway to the upper
level, or in both locations. The basement smoke alarm should
be installed in close proximity to the stairway leading to the
floor above. Where installed on an open-joisted ceiling, the
smoke alarm should be placed on the bottom of the joists. The
smoke alarm should be positioned relative to the stairway so as
to intercept smoke coming from a fire in the basement before
the smoke enters the stairway.
Are More Smoke Alarms Desirable?  The required number of
smoke alarms might not provide reliable early warning protec‐
tion for those areas separated by a door from the areas protec‐
ted by the required smoke alarms. For this reason, the use of
additional smoke alarms for those areas for increased protec‐
tion is recommended. The additional areas include dining
room, furnace room, utility room, and hallways not protected
by the required smoke alarms. The installation of smoke alarms
in kitchens, attics (finished or unfinished), or garages is not
normally recommended, because these locations occasionally
experience conditions that can result in improper operation.
A.29.8.1.1   Occupancies where smoke alarms are typically
required include residential, residential board and care, or day-
care home. The term residential occupancy is defined in 3.3.249
and includes one- and two-family dwellings; lodging or room‐
ing houses; hotels, motels, and dormitories; and apartment
buildings. The term residential board and care occupancy  is
defined in 3.3.248 and includes both small and large facilities.
NFPA 101 specifies a small facility to be one with sleeping
accommodations for not more than 16 residents. The term day-
care home , defined in 3.3.64, is a specific category of day-care
occupancy. It should be noted that applicable laws, codes, or

standards might include conditions that could impact the
applicability of these requirements. The local authority should
be consulted for specific details.
A.29.8.1.1(1)   The term sleeping room  applies to several occu‐
pancies including: one- and two-family dwellings; lodging or
rooming houses; hotels, motels, and dormitories; apartment
buildings; residential board and care facilities; and day-care
homes. The term guest room, defined in 3.3.126, is an accommo‐
dation that includes sleeping facilities. It applies in the context
of hotel and dormitory occupancies.
A.29.8.1.1(2)   The term dwelling unit  is defined in 3.3.83 and
applies to one- and two-family dwellings and dwelling units of
apartment buildings (including condominiums).
A.29.8.1.1(5)   The term guest suite  is defined in 3.3.127, and
the term living area is defined in 3.3.152.
A.29.8.1.3.1   One smoke alarm per 500 ft 2 (46 m2) is evaluated
by dividing the total interior square footage of floor area per
level by 500 ft2 (46 m2). The requirements do not preclude the
installation of smoke alarms on walls in accordance with
29.11.3.3. Some building configurations, such as division of
rooms and open foyers or great rooms, dictate that alarms be
located so that they do not cover distinctly separate 500 ft 2
(46 m2) areas but rather provide overlapping coverage relative
to this spacing requirement.

Δ A.29.8.2.1.1   As of the 2007 edition of NFPA 72 , the Code
required the interconnection of alarms for both new and exist‐
ing construction. The introduction of wireless interconnect
smoke alarms allows installation of interconnect devices in
existing construction without the need for ac wiring modifica‐
tions that once were required to retrofit interconnected alarms.
Work by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
(CPSC) has concluded that interconnection of alarms is an
important factor that can affect proper notification and life
safety [1, 2]. The CPSC study shows that interconnected smoke
alarms alerted residents to the fire more than twice as often as
noninterconnected alarms. A Victoria University study [3] also
emphasizes the need for interconnected alarms. The study
indicates that interconnected smoke alarms in every room in
every dwelling would lead to about 50 percent fewer fatalities.
A study by Underwriters Laboratories shows the benefit of
interconnection [4].

A.29.8.2.2   One of the common problems associated with
smoke alarms and detectors is the nuisance alarms that are
usually triggered by products of combustion from cooking,
smoking, or other household particulates. While an alarm for
such a condition is anticipated and tolerated by the occupant
of a dwelling unit through routine living experience, the alarm
is not permitted where it also sounds alarms in other dwelling
units or in common use spaces. Nuisance alarms caused by
cooking are a very common occurrence, and inspection author‐
ities should be aware of the possible ramifications where the
coverage is extended beyond the limits of the dwelling unit.
N A.29.9.4(3)   Restraining means are not intended to be used
where the detector or alarm is designed to be plugged directly
into a receptacle without a cord.
A.29.10.2   The UL listing for smoke alarms addresses two cate‐
gories of these devices: one for applications where sensitivity
testing is not required (UTGT), and one for applications where
sensitivity testing is required (UTHA). Refer to the testing
requirements for these devices in Chapter 14.
N A.29.10.3.1   ANSI/UL 2034, Standard for Single and Multiple
Station Carbon Monoxide Alarms, includes a level below which the
alarm should not respond.
A.29.10.4   The linear space rating is the maximum allowable
distance between heat detectors. The linear space rating is also
a measure of detector response time to a standard test fire
when tested at the same distance. A higher rating corresponds
to a faster response time. This Code recognizes only those heat
detectors with ratings of 50 ft (15.2 m) or more.
A.29.10.4.2   A heat detector with a temperature rating some‐
what in excess of the highest normally expected ambient
temperature is specified in order to avoid the possibility of
premature response of the heat detector to non-fire conditions.
Some areas or rooms of the dwelling unit can experience
ambient temperatures considerably higher than those in the
normally occupied living spaces. Examples are unfinished
attics, the space near hot air registers, and some furnace

rooms. This fact should be considered in the selection of the
appropriate temperature rating for fixed-temperature heat
detectors to be installed in these areas or rooms.
A.29.10.6.2   Listed household fire alarm systems have a means
to allow users to cancel or abort an actuate fire alarm signal
when they know it is an unwanted alarm.
A.29.10.7.8   Such input and output devices include, but are
not limited to, relay modules, notification appliances, phone
dialers, system control units, heat detectors, and manual fire
alarm boxes.
Δ A.29.10.8.2.1   For RF waves traveling along the earth’s surface,
the signal power loss (in dB), Lp, can be calculated using the
following plane-earth propagation loss model:

where Dp represents the distance between the transmitter
and receiver and hTX and hRX are the heights of the transmitter
and receiver, respectively, above the earth.
The plane earth propagation model is a practical simplifica‐
tion and requires that hTX, hRX << Dp. It reflects the average
expected attenuation due to distance of the RF carrier for a
stationary set of radios with an essentially clear line of sight. It
predicts maximum communications range only in the UHF
band (300 MHz to 3 GHz) and is not dependent on frequency.
Inside a building, the model can be expanded to determine
the total path loss, LT, which includes the plane earth loss, Lp
(equation A. 29.10.8.2.1a), and the loss due to the building
materials in the propagation path, Lb, as follows:

The DEOAT function is used to calculate a test distance

ucts. As noted above in the right side of equation
A.29.10.8.2.1d, the function represents two factors — one that
describes the attenuation of a radio frequency signal due to
plane earth propagation path loss ( Dp), and one that describes

[A.29.10.8.2.1c]
 
[A.29.10.8.2.1d]
the dwelling material losses ( Lb) in the signal’s propagation
path. It is the combination of dwelling loss and propagation
path loss that is used in the calculation of the test distance
DEOAT. The losses are expressed in dB, and the unit for distances
is meter.
In reviewing average home sizes, a reliable (indoor) commu‐
nication of 100 ft (30.5 m) is adequate for a majority of dwell‐
ings, based on an average house size of 2200 ft 2 (204 m 2)
[National Association of Home Builders]. Construction materi‐
als of a home (walls and floors) can attenuate an RF signal,
with the RF signal being attenuated more at higher frequencies
[Stone, 1997]. Communication specifications for devices of this
type are typically specified as open field (no obstructions) test
distances and not in terms of attenuation. Therefore, the stand‐
ard specifies a minimum open area test distance, DEOAT, that the
RF products must communicate. This distance is equal to 100 ft
(30.5 m) (the longest straight line distance within a majority of
homes) plus an additional distance that is equivalent to the
attenuation of four walls and two floors (the most straight line
obstructions in a majority of homes). The additional distance
varies depending on the operating frequency of the product.
Formulas for calculating DEOAT are included below, along with
examples for a number of different frequencies. These criteria
are expected to yield reliable indoor communications at 100 ft
(30.5 m) when used inside a majority of dwellings.
The building attenuation factor, Lb, represents the maximum
attenuation value of typical floors and walls within a majority of
structures. Lb is calculated using attenuation values of different
materials. The following method is used to calculate Lb. The
building materials attenuation coefficients specified in this
application are taken from Stone, 1997. Other sources of
appropriate building material attenuation coefficients can be
used; however, testing organizations should apply values consis‐
tently for all products tested.
L1 = frequency-dependent attenuation value for 1∕2 in.
(13 mm) drywall
L2 = frequency-dependent attenuation value for 1 1∕2 in.
(38 mm) structural lumber
L3 = frequency-dependent attenuation value for 3∕4 in.
(19 mm) plywood
L4 = frequency-dependent attenuation value for 1∕2 in.
(13 mm) glass/tile floor
Lw = Attenuation value of a wall = 2 × L1 + L2
Lf = Attenuation value of a floor = L1 + L2 + L3 + L4
Assuming four walls and two floors,
L L Lb w f= × + ×4 2
The source for the equation in 29.10.8.2.1 is Stone, W. “Elec‐
tromagnetic Attenuation in Construction Materials,” National
Institute of Standards and Technology, NISTIR 6055, 1997.
A.29.10.8.2.4   Receiving units that stay in alarm for 30 seconds
or 1 minute longer than the transmitting alarm would provide
additional protection if the first alarm is damaged due to a very
fast growing fire. The persisting alarm signal would provide
additional notification to occupants. This option needs to be
considered in light of the potential for the longer alarm signals

on receiving smoke alarms being a potential nuisance to occu‐
pants during test and other nuisance alarm events.
N A.29.10.9.1   NFPA 72  does not require single- and multiple-
station alarms and household alarm systems to send signals off-
premises. However, if such supervision is elected by the owner
or required by some other governing laws, codes, or standards,
this section requires that it be done in accordance with other
parts of this Code, except as noted.
N A.29.10.9.2   Upon receipt of a carbon monoxide (CO) alarm
signal, supervising station personnel should perform the
following actions in the order listed:
(1) Where required by the emergency response agency,
immediately retransmit indication of the carbon monox‐
ide alarm signal to the communications center.
(2) The immediate retransmission should be permitted to be
delayed by not more than 90 seconds where the jurisdic‐
tion permits the supervising station to first contact the
protected premises to determine if the alarm was initiated
by the activation of a test.
(3) Contact the responsible party(s) in accordance with the
notification plan.
(4) Once contacted, the subscriber should be informed to
take action in accordance with the manufacturer's
published instructions, or where the manufacturer's
published instructions are not available, the subscriber
should be advised to take the following actions:
(a) Immediately move to fresh air, either outdoors or by
an open door or window.
(b) Verify that all occupants are accounted for.
(c) Do not reenter the premises or move away from an
open door or window until the emergency service
responders have arrived, the premises have been
aired out, and the alarm remains in its normal
condition.
A.29.10.9.7   Where 29.10.9.7, which provides for screening
alarm signals to minimize response to false alarms, is to be
implemented, the following should be considered:
(1) Was the verification call answered at the protected prem‐
ises?
(2) Did the respondent provide proper identification?
(3) Is it necessary for the respondent to identify the cause of
the alarm signal?
(4) Should the public service fire communications center be
notified and advised that an alarm signal was received,
including the response to the verification call, when an
authorized respondent states that fire service response is
not desired?
(5) Should the public service fire communications center be
notified and advised that an alarm signal was received,
including the response to the verification call, for all
other situations, including both a hostile fire and no
answer to the verification call?
(6) What other actions should be required by a standard
operating procedure?
•
A.29.11.2.1   Once these limits have been exceeded, a house‐
hold fire alarm and/or carbon monoxide detection system
should be installed.
Δ A.29.11.3   One of the most critical factors of any fire alarm
system is the location of the fire detecting devices. This annex
is not a technical study. It is an attempt to provide some funda‐
mentals on fire-warning equipment location. For simplicity,
only those types of alarms or detectors recognized by Chap‐
ter 29 (e.g., smoke and heat alarms or smoke and heat detec‐
tors) are discussed. Specific mounting locations of fire-warning
equipment in unoccupied or architecturally unique areas (e.g.,
as in attics or in rooms with high ceilings) should be evaluated
by a qualified professional.
The conclusions of the Kemano Study and FPRF Smoke
Detector Spacing Requirements Report (2008) have deter‐
mined revisions to smoke alarm and smoke detector mounting
within 4 in. (100 mm) of a flat ceiling/wall corner are now
acceptable. The studies have shown that acceptable detection
performance does not depend on the 4 in. (100 mm) separa‐
tion. Figure A.29.11.3 illustrates acceptable smoke alarm and
smoke detector mounting locations.

A.29.11.3.3   Figure A.29.11.3 illustrates acceptable smoke
alarm or smoke detector mounting locations.
In those dwelling units employing radiant heating in the
ceiling, the wall location is the recommended location. Radiant
heating in the ceiling can create a hot air boundary layer along
the ceiling surface, which can seriously restrict the movement
of smoke and heat to a ceiling-mounted detector.
A.29.11.3.4(3)   Smoke detectors and smoke alarms should be
installed in those locations recommended by the manufactur‐
er’s published instructions, except in those cases where the
space above the ceiling is open to the outside and little or no
insulation is present over the ceiling. Such cases result in the
ceiling being excessively cold in the winter or excessively hot in
the summer. Where the ceiling is significantly different in
temperature from the air space below, smoke and heat have
difficulty reaching the ceiling and a detector that is located on
that ceiling.
A.29.11.3.4(4)   As per annex material located in A.29.8.1, it is
not normally recommended that smoke alarms or smoke detec‐
tors be placed in kitchen spaces. This section of the code
provides guidelines for safe installation if a need exists to install
a smoke alarm or smoke detector in a residential kitchen space
or cooking area.
Within this Code section, a fixed cooking appliance is any
appliance that is intended to be permanently connected elec‐
trically to the wiring system or the fuel source. A stationary
cooking appliance is any appliance that is intended to be
fastened in place or located in a dedicated space, and is
connected to the supply circuit or fuel source.
Smoke alarms and smoke detectors that are currently availa‐
ble to consumers are susceptible to particles released into the
air during normal cooking procedures. If smoke alarms and
smoke detectors are placed too close to the area where the
cooking source originates, a high level of nuisance alarms can
occur. Frequent nuisance alarms can result in an occupant disa‐
bling the smoke alarm or smoke detector.
Nuisance alarm studies show that commercially available
residential smoke alarms and smoke detectors are susceptible
to nuisance alarms when installed too close to cooking applian‐
ces. As the horizontal distance between the smoke alarm or
smoke detectors and the cooking appliance increases, the
frequency of nuisance alarms decreases. Smoke alarms or
smoke detectors that use ionization smoke detection have been
shown to be more susceptible to cooking nuisance alarms than
those that use photoelectric smoke detection when the alarms
or detectors are installed within 10 ft (3.0 m) along a horizon‐
36 in. (910 mm)

tal smoke travel path from a cooking appliance. Smoke alarms
or smoke detectors that use photoelectric smoke detection
produce nuisance alarms when installed less than 10 ft (3.0 m)
from a cooking appliance, though to a lesser degree.
The occurrence of the higher frequency of nuisance alarms
observed in smoke alarms or smoke detectors that use ioniza‐
tion detection have been documented in the fire research data.
Due to the differences in technology between ionization detec‐
tion and photoelectric detection, the sensitivity typically used
for ionization detection is much higher than that used for
photoelectric detection. This sensitivity difference is a result of
each type of the detection being required to satisfy UL 217
performance tests. Removing detection technology from
consideration, the frequency of nuisance alarms is solely due to
the sensitivity of the detection method used. Thus, both ioniza‐
tion and photoelectric detector technologies will produce
nuisance alarms due to cooking, but currently available smoke
alarms and smoke detectors that use ionization detection typi‐
cally produce more cooking-related nuisance alarms.
The higher sensitivities of currently available smoke alarms
and smoke detectors that use ionization detection do provide a
benefit at the expense of a potentially higher rate of cooking-
related nuisance alarms. Research has demonstrated that ioni‐
zation detection will typically respond faster than photoelectric
detection to flaming fires, providing earlier warning to occu‐
pants that might allow for quicker intervention or faster egress.
In general, the installation of smoke alarms or smoke detectors
that use ionization detection will result in increased fire safety
at the risk of a higher frequency of nuisance alarms. The instal‐
lation of smoke alarms or smoke detectors that use photoelec‐
tric detection will result in reduced fire safety for flaming fires
and a reduced risk of nuisance alarms. Based on the trade-off
between faster response to fires and the frequency of nuisance
alarms, detectors that utilize both technologies (i.e., ionization,
photoelectric, and a combination) are allowed to be installed
between 10 ft (3.0 m) and 20 ft (6.1 m) along a horizontal flow
path from a standard or fixed cooking appliance if the specific
detector is equipped with an alarm silencing means or is of the
photoelectric-type.
Nuisance alarm studies provide data on cooking nuisances
that emanate from both fixed cooking appliances and station‐
ary cooking appliances (e.g., stove, oven) as well as portable
cooking appliances (e.g., toaster). Based on these studies,
which demonstrate the potential of all cooking appliances to
generate nuisance sources, a zone of exclusion has been speci‐
fied surrounding each stationary or fixed cooking appliance.
The purpose of this zone is to limit the installation of smoke
alarms and detectors in areas where stationary, fixed, or porta‐
ble cooking appliances will be located within the residential
kitchen space such that potential nuisance alarms are mini‐
mized. The size of the zone of exclusion is specified to attempt
to take into account the unknown and transitory locations of
portable cooking appliances. This zone of exclusion is deter‐
mined by measuring a 10 ft (3.0 m) radial distance from the
closest edge of a stationary or fixed cooking appliance. The
zone of exclusion is not intended to pass through walls or door‐
ways. Figure A.29.11.3.4(4)(a) provides an example of the zone
of exclusion in a generalized residential kitchen.
If other areas of this code require that a smoke alarm or
smoke detector be placed within a horizontal flow path
distance between 10 ft (3.0 m) and 20 ft (6.1 m) from a station‐
ary or fixed cooking appliance, the following method should

be used to determine the distance, and only photoelectric
detection or smoke alarms/detectors with alarm silencing
means can be installed in this area.
To install a smoke alarm or detector between 10 ft (3.0 m)
and 20 ft (6.1 m) from the cooking appliance, an installer must
first determine the 10 ft (3.0 m) area of exclusion. Once the
area of exclusion is determined, an installer must then deter‐
mine the horizontal flow distance. This is the horizontal
distance along the ceiling from the closest edge of the cooking
appliance to the smoke alarm or detector. The horizontal
distance can consist of line segments due to impediments, such
as interior partitions. Once an impediment is met, the meas‐
urement of the distance will then continue along the new hori‐
zontal path segment until the distance requirement is met or
another impediment is encountered. Figure A.29.11.3.4(4)(b)
provides an example for placement outside a kitchen in a
nearby hallway. Figure A.29.11.3.4(4)(c) provides another
example of appropriate placement outside of a kitchen in an
adjacent room.
At a horizontal flow path distance of greater than 20 ft
(6.1 m), any type of smoke alarm or smoke detector can be
installed.
In rare cases, a residential dwelling can be of such size and
configuration that an area of exclusion of 10 ft (3.0 m) from a
stationary or fixed cooking appliance excludes the placement
of a smoke alarm or smoke detector required by other areas of
this Code. In these cases, a smoke alarm or smoke detector
using photoelectric detection can be installed at least 72 in.
(1.83 m) from the fixed or stationary cooking appliance.
Figure A.29.11.3.4(4)(d) provides an example of this situation
in practice where a smoke alarm or smoke detector is required
outside of the sleeping area, but the space is in close proximity
to the kitchen space.

A.29.11.3.4(7)   Studies indicate that smoke alarms and smoke
detectors that use ionization detection, photoelectric detec‐
tion, or a combination of ionization and photoelectric detec‐
tion, are susceptible to nuisance alarms caused by steam. Little
research has been done on the comparative response of these
types of detection to steam. Steam particles, in general, are visi‐
ble, reflect light easily, and are typically produced in a size
range that would be more likely to actuate a photoelectric
sensor. Thus, it is required that smoke alarms and smoke detec‐
tors be installed greater than 36 in. (910 mm) from the bath‐
room door where possible. Increasing the distance between the
smoke alarm or smoke detector and the bathroom door can
reduce the frequency of nuisance alarms from bathroom
steam. Frequent nuisance alarms can result in the occupant
disabling the smoke alarm. Each incremental increase in sepa‐
ration, up to 10 ft (3.0 m), between the bathroom door and the
smoke alarm or smoke detector is expected to reduce the
frequency of nuisance alarms.
N A.29.11.3.4(9)   There are circumstances in which the place‐
ment of smoke alarms and detectors cannot physically meet the
requirement to be 36 in. (910 mm) or further away from the
tip of the fan blade. Consequently, there is an irreconcilable
conflict in enforcing all siting requirements of this standard, so
the requirement of 29.11.3.4(10) only applies where possible to
allow compliance with this standard. A limited study (Gottuk
and Gottuk 2015) has indicated that placing alarms closer than
36 in. (910 mm) is not expected to produce an unacceptable
risk, and in some cases, could improve performance.

A.29.11.4   While Chapter 29 does not require heat alarms or
heat detectors as part of the basic protection scheme, it is
recommended that the householder consider the use and
placement of additional heat detectors for the same reasons
presented under A.29.11.3. For example, additional heat
alarms or heat detectors could be considered, but not limited
to, the following areas: kitchen, dining room, attic (finished or
unfinished), furnace room, utility room, basement, and inte‐
gral or attached garage.
The placement of the heat alarm or heat detector is critical
where maximum speed of fire detection is desired. Thus, a logi‐
cal location for a heat alarm or heat detector is the center of
the ceiling. At this location, the heat alarm or heat detector is
closest to all areas of the room.
A.29.11.4.1   Heat Alarm or Heat Detector Mounting — Dead Air
Space. Heat from a fire rises to the ceiling, spreads out across
the ceiling surface, and begins to bank down from the ceiling.
The corner where the ceiling and the wall meet is an air space
into which heat has difficulty penetrating. In most fires, this
dead air space measures about 4 in. (100 mm) along the ceil‐
ing from the corner and about 4 in. (100 mm) down the wall as
shown in Figure A.17.6.3.1.3.1. Heat alarm or heat detectors
should not be placed in this dead air space.
A.29.11.4.2   Figure A.29.11.3.2 illustrates acceptable heat
alarm or heat detector mounting locations for sloped ceilings.
A.29.11.4.4   Spacing of Detectors.  Where a room is too large for
protection by a single heat alarm or heat detector, multiple
alarms or detectors should be used. It is important that they be
properly located so all parts of the room are covered. (For
further information on the spacing of detectors, see Chapter 17.)
Where the Distance Between Detectors Should Be Further Reduced.
The distance between detectors is based on data obtained from
the spread of heat across a smooth ceiling. Where the ceiling is
not smooth, the placement of the heat alarm or heat detector
should be tailored to the situation.
Anywhere along this bold surface

Figure A.17.6.3.1.3.1 illustrates acceptable heat alarms or
heat detector mounting locations for smooth ceilings and side‐
walls.
A.29.11.4.7   Refer to Figure A.29.11.4.7, where the distance
between heat alarms or heat detectors should be further
reduced.
For instance, with open wood joists, heat travels freely down
the joist channels so that the maximum distance between the
heat alarm or heat detectors [(50 ft) 15.2 m] can be used.
However, heat has trouble spreading across the joists, so the
distance in this direction should be one-half the distance
allowed between detectors, as shown in Figure A.29.11.4.7, and
the distance to the wall is reduced to 12.5 ft (3.8 m). Since one-
half of 50 ft (15.2 m) is 25 ft (7.6 m), the distance between heat
alarms or detectors across open wood joists should not exceed
25 ft (7.6 m), as shown in Figure A.29.11.4.7, and the distance
to the wall is reduced [one-half of 25 ft (7.6 m)] to 12.5 ft
(3.8 m). Paragraph 29.11.4.6 requires that a heat alarm or heat
detectors be mounted on the bottom of the joists and not up in
joist channels.
Walls, partitions, doorways, ceiling beams, and open joists
interrupt the normal flow of heat, thus creating new areas to be
protected.
In addition to the special requirements for heat detectors
installed on ceilings with exposed joists, reduced spacing also
might be required due to other structural characteristics of the
protected area, possible drafts, or other conditions that could
affect heat alarm or detector operation.
N A.29.14.5(7)   Actions that should be considered include open‐
ing windows and doors and evacuation. Also, the information
should provide examples of organizations to be contacted for
assistance.

ANNEX B 72-313
Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material. 2019 Edition
Annex B   Engineering Guide for Automatic Fire Detector
Spacing
This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document
but is included for informational purposes only.
Users of Annex B should refer back to the text of NFPA 72 to famili‐
arize themselves with the limitations of the design methods summarized
herein.
Section B.2, and particularly B.2.2 and B.2.3, are largely based on
the work of Custer and Meacham as found in “Performance-Based Fire
Safety Engineering: An Introduction of Basic Concepts” (Meacham
and Custer 1995) and Introduction to Performance-Based Fire Safety
(Custer and Meacham 1997). [25]
The National Fire Protection Association and the Technical Commit‐
tee on Initiating Devices for Fire Alarm Systems gratefully acknowledge
the technical contributions of the Society of Fire Protection Engineers,
Richard Custer, and Brian Meacham to performance-based design and
this annex.
B.1 Introduction.
B.1.1 Scope.    Annex B provides information intended to
supplement Chapter 17. It includes a procedure for determin‐
ing detector spacing based on the objectives set for the system,
size, and rate of growth of fire to be detected, various ceiling
heights, ambient temperatures, and response characteristics of
the detectors. In addition to providing an engineering method
for the design of detection systems using plume-dependent
detectors, heat detectors, and smoke detectors, this annex also
provides guidance on the use of radiant energy–sensing detec‐
tors.
B.1.2 General.
B.1.2.1   In the 1999 edition Annex B was revised in its entirety
from previous editions. The correlations originally used to
develop the tables and graphs for heat and smoke detector
spacings in the earlier editions have been updated to be consis‐
tent with current research. These revisions correct the errors in
the original correlations. In earlier editions, the tables and
graphs were based on an assumed heat of combustion of
20,900 kJ/kg (8986 Btu/lb). The effective heat of combustion
for common cellulosic materials is usually taken to be approxi‐
mately 12,500 kJ/kg (5374 Btu/lb). The equations in this
annex were produced using test data and data correlations for
cellulosic (wood) fuels that have a total heat of combustion of
about 12,500 kJ/kg (5374 Btu/lb).
B.1.2.2   In addition to the revisions undertaken in 1999, the
concept of performance-based design was further expanded
on. This included, to a large extent, additional material taken
from the work of Custer and Meacham  [25]. Since this time,
the industry continues to develop additional codes, standards,
and guides to further assist in undertaking a performance-
based assessment. This includes the work of SFPE [40, 49],
NFPA [50, 51, 52], and ICC [53].
B.1.2.3   For the purposes of this annex, the heat produced by
a fire is manifested either as convective heat or radiant heat. It
is assumed that conductive heat transfer is of little consequence
during the early stages of the development of a fire, where this
annex is relevant. A convective heat release rate fraction equal
to 75 percent of the total heat release rate has been used in this
annex. Users should refer to references 12 and 13 in I.1.2.18
for fuels or burning conditions that are substantially different
from these conditions.
B.1.2.4   The design methods for plume-dependent fire detec‐
tors provided in this annex are based on full-scale fire tests
funded by the Fire Detection Institute in which all fires were
geometrically growing flaming fires. (See Environments of Fire
Detectors — Phase 1: Effect of Fire Size, Ceiling Height and Material;
Measurements Vol. I and Analysis Vol. II [10].)
B.1.2.5   The guidance applicable to smoke detectors is limited
to a theoretical analysis based on the flaming fire test data and
is not intended to address the detection of smoldering fires.
B.1.2.6   The design methods for plume-dependent fire detec‐
tors do not address the detection of steady-state fires.
B.1.2.7   The design methods for plume-dependent fire detec‐
tors used in this annex are only applicable when employed in
the context of applications where the ceiling is smooth and
level. They cannot be used for ceilings where there are beams,
joists, or bays formed by beams and purlins. The research upon
which the following methods have been based did not consider
the effect of beams, joists, and bays in sufficient detail to justify
the use of this annex to those applications.
B.1.3 Purpose.
Δ B.1.3.1   The purpose of Annex B is to provide a performance
basis for the location and spacing of fire detection–initiating
devices. The sections for heat and smoke detectors provide an
alternative design method to the prescriptive approach presen‐
ted in Chapter 17 (i.e., based on their listed spacings). The
section on radiant energy–sensing detectors elaborates on the
performance-based criteria already existing in Chapter 17. A
performance-based approach allows one to consider potential
fire growth rates and fire signatures, the individual compart‐
ment characteristics, and damageability characteristics of the
targets (e.g., occupants, equipment, contents, structures, and
so on) in order to determine the location of a specific type of
detector to meet the objectives established for the system.
B.1.3.2   Under the prescriptive approach, heat detectors are
installed according to their listed spacing. The listed spacing is
determined in a full-scale fire test room. The fire test room
used for the determination of listed spacing for heat detectors
has a ceiling height of 4.8 m (15 ft 9 in.). A steady-state, flam‐
mable liquid fire with a heat release rate of approximately
1137 kW (1200 Btu/sec), located 0.9 m (3 ft) above the floor, is
used as the test fire. Special 71°C (160°F) test sprinklers are
installed on a 3 m × 3 m (10 ft × 10 ft) spacing array such that
the fire is in the center of the sprinkler array. The heat detec‐
tors being tested are installed in a square array with increasing
spacing centered about the fire location. The elevation of the
test fire is adjusted during the test to produce the temperature
versus time curve at the test sprinkler heads to yield actuation
of the heads in 2.0 minutes ±10 seconds. The largest heat
detector spacing that achieves alarm before the actuation of
the sprinkler heads in the test becomes the listed spacing for
the heat detector. See Figure A.17.6.3.1.1(c). If the room
dimensions, ambient conditions, and fire and response charac‐
teristics of the detector are different from above, the response
of the heat detector must be expected to be different as well.
Therefore, the use of an installed detector spacing that is
different from the listed spacing might be warranted through
the use of a performance-based approach if the conditions are
as follows:
(1) The design objectives are different from designing a
system that operates at the same time as a sprinkler in the
approval test.

(2) Faster response of the device is desired.
(3) A response of the device to a smaller fire than used in the
approved test is required.
(4) Accommodation to room geometry that is different from
that used in the listing process.
(5) Other special considerations, such as ambient tempera‐
ture, air movement, ceiling height, or other obstruction,
are different from or are not considered in the approval
tests.
(6) A fire other than a steady state 1137 kW (1200 Btu/sec)
fire is contemplated.
B.1.3.3   The designer of fire alarm systems needs to be knowl‐
edgeable in the applicable areas associated with undertaking a
performance-based design, including fire dynamics,
performance-based design, detector response, and so forth,
and apply these principles judiciously. In addition, the majority
of jurisdictions consider the design of fire alarm systems as
“engineering work.” They therefore require licensed engineers
to perform such work. Other jurisdictions allow technologists
to lay out fire alarm systems as long as they follow the appropri‐
ate prescriptive requirements. Designers who are using a
performance-based design approach need to review the rele‐
vant engineering licensure laws in the jurisdictions in which
they are practicing, as performance-based designs might very
likely be deemed engineering and of the type that requires
licensure of a professional engineer.
B.2 Performance-Based Approach to Designing and Analyzing
Fire Detection Systems.
Δ B.2.1 Overview.    Subsection B.2.1 provides an overview of a
systematic approach to conducting a performance-based design
or analysis of a fire detection system. The approach has been
outlined by Custer and Meacham and the SFPE Engineering
Guide to Performance Based Fire Protection  [40] and is summarized
below in the context of design and analysis of fire detection
systems. (Refer to Figure B.2.1.)  This approach has been divided

design and evaluation.

B.2.2.1.1   The initial step of this approach is to identify infor‐
mation relative to the overall scope of work on the project,
including characteristics of the building, design intent, design
and construction team organization, constraints on design and
project schedule, proposed building construction and features,
relevant hazards, how the building functions, occupant charac‐
teristics, and so forth. Additional information that one might
want to consider could also include characteristics of the fire
departments, historic preservation, building management, and
applicable regulations.
B.2.2.1.2   While defining the project’s scope, the designer will
identify which of the three situations in Table B.2.2.1.2 best
describes the project at hand (i.e., a performance-based analy‐
sis of an existing detection system in an existing building).
B.2.2.2 Identify Goals.
B.2.2.2.1   Fire protection assets are acquired in order to attain
one or more of the following four goals:
(1) To provide life safety (occupants, employees, fire fighters,
and so forth)
(2) To protect property and heritage (structure, contents,
and so forth)
(3) To provide for continuity of operations (protect stake‐
holder’s mission, operating capability, and so forth)
(4) To limit the environmental impact of fire (toxic products,
fire-fighting water run-off, and so forth)
B.2.2.2.2   Fire protection goals are like other goals in that they
are generally easy to agree on, are qualitative, and are noncon‐
troversial in nature. They express the desired overall outcome
to be achieved, that is, to provide life safety to the building
occupants.
B.2.2.2.3   When starting the performance-based process, the
various parties — including the stakeholders (i.e., the architect,
building owner, insurance carrier, building or fire officials, and
so forth), the authority having jurisdiction, and the design
engineer — work together to prioritize the basic fire protection
goals. Prioritizing is based on the stakeholder’s objective and
the building and occupancy involved. For example, life safety is
a high priority in a hospital or stadium, while property protec‐
tion might have an equally high priority in a large warehouse
or historic building.
B.2.2.3 Identify Stakeholder’s Objectives.
B.2.2.3.1   Each stakeholder must explicitly state her or his
objectives in terms of acceptable loss for the various goals previ‐
ously stated.
B.2.2.3.2   Stakeholder objectives specify how much safety the
stakeholder wants, needs, or can afford. “No loss of life within
the room of origin” is a sample stakeholder objective or state‐
ment of the stakeholder’s maximum acceptable loss.
Table B.2.2.1.2  Design/Analysis Situation
Building Type System Type Design/Analysis
New New Design
Existing New Design
Existing Existing Analysis
B.2.2.3.3   The stakeholder’s objectives are generally not stated
in fire protection engineering terms.
B.2.2.3.4   Note that in a performance-based code environ‐
ment, the Code will most likely define a performance objective
or stakeholder objective.
B.2.2.4 Define Design Objectives.
B.2.2.4.1   The stakeholder’s objective must then be explicitly
stated and quantified in fire protection engineering terms that
describe how the objective will be achieved. This demands that
the design objectives be expressed quantitatively. See Table
B.2.2.4.1(a) through Table B.2.2.4.1(c).
B.2.2.4.2   The design objective provides a description of how
the stakeholder’s objective will be achieved in general fire
protection engineering terms prior to this description being
quantified. The general objective is then reduced to explicit
and quantitative fire protection engineering terms. The
explicit fire protection engineering objectives provide a
performance benchmark against which the predicted perform‐
ance of a candidate design is evaluated.

B.2.2.5 Define Performance Criteria.
B.2.2.5.1   Once the design objective has been established,
specific, quantitatively expressed criteria that indicate attain‐
ment of the performance objective are developed.
B.2.2.5.2   Performance criteria provide a yardstick or thresh‐
old values that can measure a potential design’s success in
meeting stakeholder objectives and their associated design
objectives. [25]
B.2.2.5.3   Quantification of the design objectives into perform‐
ance criteria involves determination of the various fire-induced
stresses that are a reflection of the stated loss objectives.
Performance criteria can be expressed in various terms, includ‐
ing temperature, radiant flux, a rate of heat release, or concen‐
tration of a toxic or corrosive species that must not be
exceeded.
B.2.2.5.4   Once the design performance criteria are estab‐
lished, appropriate safety factors are applied to obtain the
working design criteria. The working design criteria reflect the
performance that must be achieved by the detection system.
This performance level must allow appropriate actions to be
undertaken (e.g., actuate suppression systems, occupants'
egress, notify fire department, and so forth) to meet the objec‐
tives. An acceptable fire detection system design provides the
detection of the fire sufficiently early in its development to
permit the other fire protection systems to meet or exceed the
relevant performance criteria established for those systems.
B.2.2.5.5   Throughout the process identified as Phase I and II,
communication should be maintained with the authorities
having jurisdiction (AHJs) to review and develop consensus on
the approach being taken. It is recommended that this commu‐
nication commence as early in the design process as possible.
The AHJ should also be involved in the development of
performance criteria. Often the acceptance of a performance-
based design in lieu of a design based on a prescriptive
approach relies on demonstrating equivalence. This is called
the comparative method, where the designer demonstrates that
the performance-based design responds at least as well as, if
not better than, a system designed using a prescriptive
approach.
B.2.3 Phase II — System Design and Evaluation.
B.2.3.1 Develop Fire Scenarios.
B.2.3.1.1 General.
B.2.3.1.1.1   A fire scenario defines the development of a fire
and the spread of combustion products throughout a compart‐
ment or building. A fire scenario represents a set of fire condi‐
tions that are deemed a threat to a building and its occupants
and/or contents, and, therefore, should be addressed in the
design of the fire protection features of the structure. [25]
B.2.3.1.1.2   The process of developing a fire scenario is a
combination of hazard analysis and risk analysis. The hazard
analysis identifies potential ignition sources, fuels, and fire
development. Risk is the probability of occurrence multiplied
by the consequences of that occurrence. The risk analysis looks
at the impact of the fire to the surroundings or target items.
B.2.3.1.1.3   The fire scenario should include a description of
various conditions, including building characteristics, occupant
characteristics, and fire characteristics. [25, 40]
B.2.3.1.2 Building Characteristics.    Building characteristics
include the following:
(1) Configuration (area; ceiling height; ceiling configuration,
such as flat, sloped beams; windows and doors, and ther‐
modynamic properties)
(2) Environment (ambient temperature, humidity, back‐
ground noise, and so forth)
(3) Equipment (heat-producing equipment, HVAC, manufac‐
turing equipment, and so forth)
(4) Functioning characteristics (occupied, during times, days,
and so forth)
(5) Target locations
(6) Potential ignition sources
(7) Aesthetic or historic preservation considerations
(Note target items — that is, areas associated with stake‐
holder objectives — along the expected route of spread for
flame, heat, or other combustion products.)
B.2.3.1.3 Occupant Characteristics.    Occupant characteristics
include the following:
(1) Alertness (sleeping, awake, and so forth)
(2) Age
(3) Mobility
(4) Quantity and location within the building
(5) Sex
(6) Responsiveness
(7) Familiarity with the building
(8) Mental challenges
Human behavior plays a key role in life safety, as well as with
the other fire safety goals. (See SFPE Engineering Guide to Human
Behavior in Fire.) The possible actions that could be taken upon
detecting a fire as well as how one reacts once they hear an
alarm need to be considered. These actions can include alert‐
ing and rescuing other family members, gathering belongings,
interpreting or verifying the message, shutting down processes.
They should also include a look at how individuals respond on
their own as well as in group situations.
Once these occupant characteristics and their behavior have
been analyzed, one might also want to determine evacuation
times. Numerous factors again need to be considered, includ‐
ing number of occupants, distribution throughout the build‐
ing, pre-movement times, motivation, state of wakefulness,
familiarity, capacity, and layout of the means of egress.
Due to the nature of human behavior, it is difficult to accu‐
rately quantify the movements and evacuation times of occu‐
pants from a building. Thus, particular attention should be
given to assumptions and uncertainties assigned to these occu‐
pant characteristics.
B.2.3.1.4 Fire Characteristics.
B.2.3.1.4.1   Fire characteristics include the following:
(1) Ignition sources — temperature, energy, time, and area
of contact with potential fuels
(2) Initial fuels
(a) State. Fuels can come in various states (i.e., solid,
liquid, or gas). Each state can have very different
combustion characteristics (i.e., a solid block of
wood versus wood shavings versus wood dust)
(b) Type and quantity of fuel . A fire’s development and
duration depends also on what is burning.
Cellulosic-based materials burn quite differently

compared to plastics, or flammable liquids, in terms
of producing different fire growth rates, heat
release rates, and products of combustion.
(c) Fuel configuration. The geometrical arrangement of
the fuel can also influence the fire growth rate and
heat release rate. A wood block will burn very differ‐
ently from a wood crib, as there is more surface area
and ventilation, and radiation feedback between the
combustible materials is increased.
(d) Fuel location . The location of the fuel (i.e., against
wall, in corner, in open, against the ceiling) will
influence the development of the fire. Fires in the
corner of a room or against a wall will typically grow
faster than a fire located in the center of a room.
(e) Heat release rate . The rate at which heat is released
depends on the fuel’s heat of combustion, the mass
loss rate, the combustion efficiency, and the amount
of incident heat flux. The mass loss rate also directly
relates to the production rate of smoke, toxic gases,
and other products of combustion.
(f) Fire growth rate . Fires grow at various rates that are
dependent on type of fuel, configuration, and
amount of ventilation. Some fires such as confined
flammable liquid fires might not be growing fires as
their burning area is fixed. These are referred to as
steady state fires. The faster a fire develops, the
faster the temperature rises, and the faster the prod‐
ucts of combustion are produced.
(g) Production rate of combustion products (smoke, CO, CO 2,
etc.). As the characteristics of various fuels vary, so
will the type of quantity of materials generated
during combustion. Species production rates can be
estimated with species yields, which are representa‐
tive of the mass of species produced per mass of fuel
loss.
(3) Secondary fuels — proximity to initial fuels; amount;
distribution, ease of ignitibility (see initial fuels); and exten‐
sion potential (beyond compartment, structure, area, if
outside)
B.2.3.1.4.2   An example of a fire scenario in a computer room
might be as follows.
The computer room is 9.1 m × 6 m (30 ft × 20 ft) and 2.8 m
(8 ft) high. It is occupied 12 hours a day, 5 days a week. The
occupants are mobile and familiar with the building. There are
no fixed fire suppression systems protecting this location. The
fire department is capable of responding to the scene in
6 minutes, and an additional 15 minutes for fire ground evolu‐
tion is needed.
Overheating of a resistor leads to the ignition of a printed
circuit board and interconnecting cabling. This leads to a fire
that quickly extends up into the above -ceiling space containing
power and communications cabling. The burning of this
cabling produces large quantities of dense, acrid smoke and
corrosive products of combustion that spread throughout the
computer suite. This causes the loss of essential computer and
telecommunications services for 2 months.
B.2.3.2 Develop Design Fires.
B.2.3.2.1 General.
B.2.3.2.1.1   The design fire is the fire the system is intended to
detect. When specifying a design fire, the specifics regarding
the ignition, growth, steady-state output (if appropriate), and
decay of the fire are expressed quantitatively.
There are numerous analysis techniques available to identify
fire scenarios. These can typically fall into one of two catego‐
ries: probabilistic or deterministic.
Probabilistic approaches typically relate to the statistical like‐
lihood that ignition will occur, and the resultant outcome if a
fire does occur. Probabilistic approaches could use the follow‐
ing as sources of data:
(1) Fire statistics (ignition, first items ignited, and so on)
(2) Past history
(3) Hazard/failure analysis
(4) Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA)
(5) Event trees
(6) Fault trees
(7) HAZOP studies
(8) Cause-consequence analysis
Deterministic approaches use analysis or engineering judg‐
ment that is based on chemistry, physics, or correlations based
on experimental data.
The selection of the design fire scenario and the supporting
analysis techniques should be appropriate to the premise or
processes. Inappropriate scenario selection or analysis can
result in conservative designs that are not economical or
designs with unacceptably high risks.
Δ B.2.3.2.1.2   Fire development varies depending on the
combustion characteristics of the fuel or fuels involved, the
physical configuration of the fuels, the availability of combus‐
tion air, and the influences due to the compartment. Once a
stable flame is attained, most fires grow in an accelerating
pattern (see Figure B.2.3.2.3.5) , reach a steady state character‐
ized by a maximum heat release rate, and then enter into a
decay period as the availability of either fuel or combustion air
becomes limited. Fire growth and development are limited by
factors such as quantity of fuel, arrangement of fuel, quantity of
oxygen, and the effect of manual and automatic suppression
systems.
For design fires with a smoldering period, very little data are
available. The design engineer should, therefore, be careful in
specifying the duration of this period. The fire growth rate of
flaming fires is determined by a variety of factors, including the
following:
(1) Type of fuel and ease of ignition
(2) Fuel configuration and orientation
(3) Location of secondary fuel packages
(4) Proximity of fire to walls and corners
(5) Ceiling height
(6) Ventilation
It is important to note when using heat release data that the
fuel burning as well as the compartment in which it is burning
need to be considered together. A couch can produce suffi‐
cient heat to cause flashover in a small compartment, whereas
this same couch placed in a large compartment with high ceil‐
ings can cause a limited fire and never reach flashover.
Several sources for developing design fires should be
reviewed, including SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering
[41]; NFPA 101; NFPA 5000 ; and SFPE Engineering Guide to
Performance Based Fire Protection [40].

B.2.3.2.1.3   Designers might also need to consider fires that
might be related to extreme events. These can either be fires
used to trigger extreme events, or post-extreme-event-induced
fires. If these are deemed credible, then designers should take
these into consideration as design fires and also with respect to
the overall reliability, redundancy, and robustness of the detec‐
tion system to function during these types of events. [54]
B.2.3.2.2 Heat Release Rates.
B.2.3.2.2.1   Fires can be characterized by their rate of heat
release, measured in terms of the number of kW (Btu/sec) of
heat liberated. Typical maximum heat release rates ( Qm) for a
number of different fuels and fuel configurations are provided
in Table B.2.3.2.6.2(a) and Table B.2.3.2.6.2(c). The heat
release rate of a fire can be described as a product of a heat
release density and fire area using the following equation:
Q qAm =
where:
Qm = maximum or peak heat release rate [kW (Btu/sec)]
q = heat release rate density per unit floor area [kW/m2
(Btu/sec·ft2)]
A = floor area of the fuel [m2 (ft2)]
B.2.3.2.2.2   The following example is provided: A particular
hazard analysis is to be based on a fire scenario involving a
3.05 m × 3.05 m (10 ft × 10 ft) stack of wood pallets stored
1.5 m (5 ft) high. Approximately what peak heat release rate
can be expected?
From Table B.2.3.2.6.2(a), the heat release rate density ( q)
for 1.5 m (5 ft) high wood pallets is approximately 3745 kW/m2
(330 Btu/sec·ft2).
The area is 3.05 m × 3.05 m (10 ft × 10 ft), or 9.29 m 2
(100 ft2). Using equation B.1 to determine the heat release rate
yields the following:
3745 × 9.29 = 34,791 kW (330 × 100 = 33,000 Btu/sec)
As indicated in the Table B.2.3.2.6.2(a), this fire generally
produces a medium to fast fire growth rate, reaching 1055 kW
(1000 Btu/sec) in approximately 90 to 190 seconds.
B.2.3.2.3 Fire Growth Rate.
B.2.3.2.3.1   Fires can also be defined by their growth rate or
the time ( tg) it takes for the fire to reach a given heat release
rate. Previous research [16] has shown that most fires grow
exponentially and can be expressed by what is termed the
“power law fire growth model”:
Q t p≅
where:
Q = heat release rate (kW or Btu/sec)
t = time (seconds)
p = 2
 
[B.2.3.2.2.1]
 
[B.2.3.2.3.1]
B.2.3.2.3.2   In fire protection, fuel packages are often descri‐
bed as having a growth time ( tg). This is the time necessary
after the ignition with a stable flame for the fuel package to
attain a heat release rate of 1055 kW (1000 Btu/sec). The
following equations describe the growth of design fires:
Q t t
g
= ( )1055
2
2   for SI units
or
Q t t
g
= ( )1000
2
2   for inch-pound units
and thus
Q t= α 2
where:
Q = heat release rate [kW or (Btu/sec)]
α = fire growth rate [1055/tg
2 (kW/sec2) or 1000/tg
2 (Btu/sec
3)]
tg = fire growth time to reach 1055 kW (1000 Btu/sec) after
established burning
t = time after established burning occurs (seconds)
B.2.3.2.3.3   Table B.2.3.2.6.2(a) and Table B.2.3.2.6.2(e)
provide values for tg, the time necessary to reach a heat release
rate of 1055 kW (1000 Btu/sec), for a variety of materials in
various configurations.
B.2.3.2.3.4   Test data from 40 furniture calorimeter tests, as
indicated in Table B.2.3.2.6.2(e), have been used to independ‐
ently verify the power law fire growth model, Q = αt2. [14] For
reference, the table contains the test numbers used in the origi‐
nal NIST reports.
The virtual time of origin (tv) is the time at which a stable
flame had appeared and the fires began to obey the power law
fire growth model. Prior to tv, the fuels might have smoldered
but did not burn vigorously with an open flame. The model
curves are then predicted by the following equations:

Δ B.2.3.2.3.6   For purposes of this annex, fires are classified as
being either slow-, medium-, or fast-developing from the time
that established burning occurs until the fire reaches a heat
release rate of 1055 kW (1000 Btu/sec). Table B.2.3.2.3.6
results from using B.2.3.2.3.2. [See also Table B.2.3.2.6.2(a).]
B.2.3.2.4 Flame Height.
B.2.3.2.4.1   There are a number of flame height to heat
release rate correlations available that can be used to deter‐
mine an appropriate design fire. The differences in the various
correlations arise from the different data sets and curve-fitting
methods used by the researchers. One such correlation is
shown in Figure B.2.3.2.4.1. It indicates that flame height and
fire heat release rate are directly related. [2] The lines in
Figure B.2.3.2.4.1 were derived from the following equation:

Another correlation has been derived by Drysdale [42]:
I Q D c= −0 235 1 022 5. . /
where:
I = the flame height (m)
Qc = the convective heat release rate (kW)
D = the diameter of the fuel bed
These correlations will not produce the same prediction
when used for exactly the same input data. There is inherent
uncertainty in the calculated flame height due to the fact that
the flaming combustion in the diffusion regime is a dynamic
phenomenon. The designer should run multiple predictions
with bounding values to address the inherent uncertainty of
the correlations.
B.2.3.2.5 Selection of Critical Fire Size.    Because all fire
control means require a finite operation time, there is a critical
difference between the time at which the fire must be detected
and the time at which it achieves the magnitude of the design
fire. Even though a fire has been detected, this does not mean
that it stops growing. Fires typically grow exponentially until
they become ventilation controlled, and limited by the availa‐
bility of fuel, or until some type of fire suppression or extin‐
guishment is commenced. Figure B.2.3.2.5 shows that there can
be a significant increase in the heat release rate with only a
small change in time due to the exponential growth rate of
fire.

FIGURE B.2.3.2.4.1  Heat Release Rate vs. Flame Height.
B.2.3.2.5.1   Once the design objectives and the design fire
have been established, the designer will need to establish two
points on the design fire curve: QDO and QCR.
B.2.3.2.5.2   QDO represents the heat release rate, or product
release rate, which produces conditions representative of the
design objective. This is the “design fire.” However, QDO does
not represent the point in time at which detection is needed.
Detection must occur sufficiently early in the development of
the fire to allow for any intrinsic reaction time of the detection
as well as the operation time for fire suppression or extinguish‐
ing systems. There will be delays in both detection of the fire as
well as the response of equipment, or persons, to the alarm.
B.2.3.2.5.3   A critical fire size ( QCR) is identified on the curve
that accounts for the delays in detection and response. This
point represents the maximum permissible fire size at which
detection must occur that allows appropriate actions to be
taken to keep the fire from exceeding the design objective
(QDO).
B.2.3.2.5.4   Delays are inherent in both the detection system as
well as in the response of the equipment or people that need to
react once a fire is detected. Delays associated with the detec‐
tion system include a lag in the transport of combustion prod‐
ucts from the fire to the detector and response time lag of the
detector, alarm verification time, processing time of the detec‐
tor, and processing time of the control unit. Delays are also
possible with an automatic fire extinguishing system(s) or
suppression system(s). Delay can be introduced by alarm verifi‐
cation or crossed zone detection systems, filling and discharge
times of preaction systems, delays in agent release required for
occupant evacuation (e.g., CO2 systems), and the time required
to achieve extinguishment.
B.2.3.2.5.5   Occupants do not always respond immediately to a
fire alarm. The following must be accounted for when evaluat‐
ing occupant safety issues:
(1) Time expected for occupants to hear the alarm (due to
sleeping or manufacturing equipment noise)
(2) Time to decipher the message (e.g., voice alarm system)
(3) Time to decide whether to leave (get dressed, gather
belongings, call security)
(4) Time to travel to an exit
B.2.3.2.5.6   Response of the fire department or fire brigade to
a fire incident involves several different actions that need to
occur sequentially before containment and extinguishment

efforts of the fire can even begin. These actions should also be
taken into account to properly design detection systems that
meet the design objectives. These actions typically include the
following:
(1) Detection (detector delays, control unit delays, and so
forth)
(2) Notification to the monitoring station (remote, central
station, proprietary, and so forth)
(3) Notification of the fire department
(4) Alarm handling time at the fire department
(5) Turnout time at the station
(6) Travel time to the incident
(7) Access to the site
(8) Set-up time on site
(9) Access to building
(10) Access to fire floor
(11) Access to area of involvement
(12) Application of extinguishant on the fire
B.2.3.2.5.7   Unless conditions that limit the availability of
combustion air or fuel exist, neither the growth of the fire nor
the resultant damage stop until fire suppression begins. The
time needed to execute each step of the fire response sequence
of actions must be quantified and documented. When design‐
ing a detection system, the sum of the time needed for each
step in the response sequence ( tdelay) must be subtracted from
the time at which the fire attains the design objective ( tDO) in
order to determine the latest time and fire size (QCR) in the fire
development at which detection can occur and still achieve the
system design objective.
B.2.3.2.5.8   The fire scenarios and design fires selected should
include analysis of best and worst-case conditions and their like‐
lihood of occurring. It is important to look at different condi‐
tions and situations and their effects on response.
B.2.3.2.6 Data Sources.
B.2.3.2.6.1   To produce a design fire curve, information is
needed regarding the burning characteristics of the object(s)
involved. Data can be obtained from either technical literature
or by conducting small or large scale calorimeter tests.
B.2.3.2.6.2   Some information is contained in Figure
B.2.3.2.6.2 and Table B.2.3.2.6.2(a) through Table
B.2.3.2.6.2(e).
B.2.3.2.6.3   Graphs of heat release data from the 40 furniture
calorimeter tests can be found in Investigation of a New Sprinkler
Sensitivity Approval Test: The Plunge Test  [8]. Best fit power law
fire growth curves have been superimposed on the graphs.
Data from these curves can be used with this guide to design or
analyze fire detection systems that are intended to respond to
similar items burning under a flat ceiling. Table B.2.3.2.6.2(e)
is a summary of the data.
B.2.3.2.6.4   In addition to heat release rate data, the original
NIST reports [ 3] contain data on particulate conversion and
radiation from the test specimens. These data can be used to
determine the threshold fire size (heat release rate) at which
tenability becomes endangered or the point at which addi‐
tional fuel packages might become involved in the fire.
B.2.3.2.6.5   The NFPA Fire Protection Handbook [22], SFPE Hand‐
book of Fire Protection Engineering , and Upholstered Furniture Heat
Release Rates Measured with a Furniture Calorimeter  [3] contain
further information on heat release rates and fire growth rates.
B.2.3.2.6.6   Technical literature searches can be performed
using a number of resources including FIREDOC, a document
base of fire literature that is maintained by NIST.
B.2.3.2.6.7   A series of design fire curves are included as part
of the “FASTLite” computer program available from NIST.
B.2.3.2.6.8   In addition, there are various organizations
conducting tests and posting results of various test data on
their websites, including the UK’s British Research Establish‐
ment (BRE), Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and NIST’s FAST‐
Data Fire Test Database.
B.2.3.3 Develop and Evaluate Candidate Fire Detection
Systems.
B.2.3.3.1   Once the design objectives, the potential fire scenar‐
ios, and the room characteristics are well understood, the
designer can select an appropriate detection strategy to detect
the fire before its critical fire size ( QCR) is reached. Important
factors to consider include the type of detector, its sensitivity to
expected fire signatures, its alarm threshold level and required
duration at that threshold, expected installed location (e.g.,
distance from fire, or below ceiling), and freedom from
nuisance response to expected ambient conditions. (See Chap‐
ter 17 and Annex A.)
B.2.3.3.2   Reliability of the detection system and individual
components should be computed and included in the selection
and evaluation of the candidate fire detection system. A
performance-based alternative design cannot be deemed
performance-equivalent unless the alternative design provides
comparable reliability to the prescriptive design it is intended
to replace.
Reliability studies can be part of RAMS studies (i.e., reliabil‐
ity, availability, maintainability, and safety). RAMS is a tool that
is used to manage dependability in “mission critical” systems.
These are all factors that should be considered to ensure the
system will continue to operate as designed, as well as provide
ease of recommended maintenance and technician safety
during maintenance.
The basis of RAMS is a systematic process, based on the
system life cycle and tasks within it, that does the following:
(1) Assists the client to specify system requirements, in terms
of dependability, from a general mission statement to
availability targets for systems , subsystems, and compo‐
nents (including software)
(2) Assesses proposed designs, using formal RAMS techni‐
ques, to see how targets are met and where objectives are
not achieved
(3) Provides a means to make recommendations to designers
and a system of hazard logging, to record and eventually
“check off” identified necessary actions
The technical concepts of availability and reliability are
based on a knowledge of and means to assess the following:
(1) All possible system failure modes in the specified applica‐
tion environment
(2) The probability (or rate) of occurrence of a system failure
mode
(3) The cause and effect of each failure mode on the func‐
tionality of the system
(4) Efficient failure detection and location
(5) The efficient restorability of the failed system

B.2.3.3.3   Various methods are available to evaluate whether a
candidate design will achieve the previously established
performance criteria. Some methods are presented in
Section B.3.
B.2.3.3.4   Candidate designs developed in the context of
comparison evaluation might require comparing the response
of the detection system designed using a performance-based
approach to that of a prescriptive-based design. It could also be
evaluated against acceptance criteria previously established
with applicable stakeholders.

In addition to the preceding operational and response char‐
acteristics that need to be considered, there might be limita‐
tions set on the amount of disruption, visibility, or the impact
the system will have on the space in which it is to be installed.
This is particularly important in heritage-type buildings where
one would want these to be as unobtrusive as possible, yet not
require ripping down ornate ceilings to install.

B.2.3.5 Management.    It is important to ensure that the
systems are designed, installed, commissioned, maintained, and
tested on regular intervals as indicated in Chapter 14. In addi‐
tion, the person conducting the testing and inspections should
be aware of the background of the design and the need to eval‐
uate not only the detector and whether it operates but also be
aware of changing conditions including the following:
(1) Changes in hazard being protected
(2) Location of the hazard changes
(3) Other hazards introduced into the area
(4) Ambient environment
(5) Invalidity of any of the design assumptions
B.3 Evaluation of Heat Detection System Performance.
B.3.1 General.    Section B.3 provides a method for determin‐
ing the application spacing for both fixed-temperature heat
detectors (including sprinklers) and rate-of-rise heat detectors.
This method is valid only for use when detectors are to be
placed on a large, flat ceiling. It predicts detector response to a
geometrically growing flaming fire at a specific fire size. This
method takes into account the effects of ceiling height, radial
distance between the detector and the fire, threshold fire size
[critical heat release rate ( QCR)], rate of fire development, and
detector response time index. For fixed-temperature detectors,
the ambient temperature and the temperature rating of the
detector are also considered. This method also allows for the
adjustment of the application spacing for fixed-temperature
heat detectors to account for variations in ambient tempera‐
ture (Ta) from standard test conditions.
B.3.1.1   This method can also be used to estimate the fire size
at which detection will occur, given an existing array of listed
heat detectors installed at a known spacing, ceiling height, and
ambient conditions.
B.3.1.2   The effect of rate of fire growth and fire size of a flam‐
ing fire, as well as the effect of ceiling height on the spacing
and response of smoke detectors, can also be determined using
this method.
B.3.1.3   The methodology contained herein uses theories of
fire development, fire plume dynamics, and detector perform‐
ance. These are considered the major factors influencing
detector response. This methodology does not address several
lesser phenomena that, in general, are considered unlikely to
have a significant influence. A discussion of ceiling drag, heat
loss to the ceiling, radiation to the detector from a fire, re-
radiation of heat from a detector to its surroundings, and the
heat of fusion of eutectic materials in fusible elements of heat
detectors and their possible limitations on the design method
are provided in References 4, 11, 16, and 18 in I.1.2.18.

B.3.1.4   The methodology in Section B.3 does not address the
effects of ceiling projections, such as beams and joists, on
detector response. While it has been shown that these compo‐
nents of a ceiling have a significant effect on the response of
heat detectors, research has not yet resulted in a simplified
method for quantifying this effect. The prescriptive adjust‐
ments to detector spacing in Chapter 17 should be applied to
application spacings derived from this methodology. Computa‐
tional fluid dynamics (CFD) programs are available and can
assist in analyzing the fire and development and spread of heat
and smoke, as well as the potential effects of varying ceiling
configurations and characteristics including sloped and
beamed ceilings.

B.3.2.2 Ambient Temperature Considerations.
B.3.2.2.1   The maximum ambient temperature expected to
occur at the ceiling will directly affect the choice of tempera‐
ture rating for a fixed-temperature heat detector application.
However, the minimum ambient temperature likely to be
present at the ceiling is also very important. When ambient
temperature at the ceiling decreases, more heat from a fire is
needed to bring the air surrounding the detector’s sensing
element up to its rated (operating) temperature. This results in
slower response when the ambient temperature is lower. In the
case of a fire that is growing over time, lower ambient tempera‐
tures result in a larger fire size at the time of detection.
B.3.2.2.2   Therefore, selection of the minimum ambient
temperature has a significant effect on the calculations. The
designer should decide what temperature to use for these
calculations and document why that temperature was chosen.
Because the response time of a given detector to a given fire is
dependent only on the detector’s time constant and the
temperature difference between ambient and the detector
rating, the use of the lowest anticipated ambient temperature
for the space results in the most conservative design. For
unheated spaces, a review of historical weather data would be
appropriate. However, such data might show extremely low
temperatures that occur relatively infrequently, such as every
100 years. Depending on actual design considerations, it might
be more appropriate to use an average minimum ambient
temperature. In any case, a sensitivity analysis should be
performed to determine the effect of changing the ambient
temperature on the design results.
B.3.2.2.3   In a room or work area that has central heating, the
minimum ambient temperature would usually be about 20°C
(68°F). On the other hand, certain warehouse occupancies
might be heated only enough to prevent water pipes from
freezing and, in this case, the minimum ambient temperature
can be considered to be 2°C (35°F), even though, during many
months of the year, the actual ambient temperature can be
much higher.
B.3.2.3 Ceiling Height Considerations.
B.3.2.3.1   A detector ordinarily operates sooner if it is nearer
to the fire. Where ceiling heights exceed 4.9 m (16 ft), ceiling
height is the dominant factor in the detection system response.
B.3.2.3.2   As flaming combustion commences, a buoyant
plume forms. The plume is comprised of the heated gases and
smoke rising from the fire. The plume assumes the general
shape of an inverted cone. The smoke concentration and
temperature within the cone varies inversely as a variable expo‐
nential function of the distance from the source. This effect is
very significant in the early stages of a fire, because the angle of
the cone is wide. As a fire intensifies, the angle of the cone
narrows and the significance of the effect of height is lessened.
B.3.2.3.3   As the ceiling height increases, a larger-size fire is
necessary to actuate the same detector in the same length of
time. In view of this, it is very important that the designer
consider the size of the fire and rate of heat release that might
develop before detection is ultimately obtained.
Δ B.3.2.3.4   The procedures presented in B.3.2.3 are based on
analysis of data for ceiling heights up to 9.1 m (30 ft). No data
were analyzed for ceiling heights greater than 9.1 m (30 ft). In
spaces where the ceiling heights exceed this limit, B.3.2.3 offers
no guidance. [40]
B.3.2.3.5   The relationships presented here are based on the
difference between the ceiling height and the height of the
fuel item involved in the fire. It is recommended that the
designer assume the fire is at floor level and use the actual
distance from floor to ceiling for the calculations. This will
yield a design that is conservative, and actual detector response
can be expected to exceed the needed speed of response in
those cases where the fire begins above floor level.
B.3.2.3.6   Where the designer desires to consider the height of
the potential fuel in the room, the distance between the base of
the fuel and the ceiling should be used in place of the ceiling
height. This design option is appropriate only if the minimum
height of the potential fuel is always constant and the concept
is approved by the authority having jurisdiction.
B.3.2.4 Operating Temperature.
B.3.2.4.1   The operating temperature, or rate of temperature
change, of the detector required for response is obtained from
the manufacturer’s data and is determined during the listing
process.
B.3.2.4.2   The difference between the rated temperature of a
fixed-temperature detector ( Ts) and the maximum ambient-
temperature (Ta) at the ceiling should be as small as possible.
However, to reduce unwanted alarms, the difference between
operating temperature and the maximum ambient tempera‐
ture should be not less than 11°C (20°F). (See Chapter 17.)
B.3.2.4.3   If using combination detectors incorporating both
fixed temperature and rate-of-rise heat detection principles to
detect a geometrically growing fire, the data contained herein
for rate-of-rise detectors should be used in selecting an instal‐
led spacing, because the rate-of-rise principle controls the
response. The fixed-temperature set point is determined from
the maximum anticipated ambient temperature.
B.3.2.5 Time Constant and Response Time Index (RTI).    The
flow of heat from the ceiling jet into a heat detector sensing
element is not instantaneous. It occurs over a period of time. A
measure of the speed with which heat transfer occurs, the ther‐
mal response coefficient is needed to accurately predict heat
detector response. This is currently called the detector time
constant (τ0). The time constant is a measure of the detector’s
sensitivity. The sensitivity of a heat detector, τ0 or RTI, should
be determined by validated test. Research by FM Global
[43,44,45] has shown that such a correlation exists and has
resulted in a test method to determine RTI. This test method is
documented in FM Approval Standard 3210, Heat Detectors for
Automatic Fire Alarm Signaling . Heat detectors should be listed
with their RTI so that heat detector spacing can be appropri‐
ately determined for various objectives and applications. For
older or existing detectors, given the detector’s listed spacing
and the detector’s rated temperature ( Ts), Table B.3.2.5, devel‐
oped in part by Heskestad and Delichatsios [10], can be used
to find the detector time constant.

B.3.2.6 Fire Growth Rate.
B.3.2.6.1   Fire growth varies depending on the combustion
characteristics and the physical configuration of the fuels
involved. After ignition, most fires grow in an accelerating
pattern. Information regarding the fire growth rate for various
fuels has been provided previously in this annex.
B.3.2.6.2   If the heat release history for a particular fire is
known, the α or tg can be calculated using curve fitting techni‐
ques for implementation into the method detailed herein. [16]
B.3.2.6.3   In most cases, the exact fuel(s) and growth rates will
not be known. Engineering judgment should therefore be used
to select α or tg that is expected to approximate the fire. Sensi‐
tivity analysis should also be performed to determine the effect
on response from changes in the expected fire growth rate. In
some analyses the effect on response will be negligible. Other
cases might show that a more thorough analysis of potential
fuels and fire scenarios is necessary.
Δ B.3.2.7 Threshold Fire Size.    The user should refer to B.2.3.1
and B.2.3.2regarding discussions on determining threshold fire
sizes (QDO and QCR) to meet the design objectives.
B.3.3 Heat Detector Spacing.
B.3.3.1 Fixed-Temperature Heat Detector Spacing.    The
following method can be used to determine the response of
fixed-temperature heat detectors for designing or analyzing
heat detection systems.
B.3.3.1.1   The objective of designing a detection system is to
determine the spacing of detectors required to respond to a
given set of conditions and goals. To achieve the objectives,
detector response must occur when the fire reaches a critical
heat release rate, or in a specified time.
B.3.3.1.2   When analyzing an existing detection system, the
designer is looking to determine the size of the fire at the time
that the detector responds.
B.3.3.2 Theoretical Background.    [26, 28] The design and
analysis methods contained in Annex B are the joint result of
extensive experimental work and of mathematical modeling of
the heat and mass transfer processes involved. The original
method was developed by Heskestad and Delichatsios [9, 10],
Beyler [4], and Schifiliti [16]. It was recently updated by
Marrion [28] to reflect changes in the original correlations as
discussed in work by Heskestad and Delichatsios [11] and
Marrion [27]. Additional research has been conducted by FM
Global [43, 44, 45]. Paragraph B.3.3.2 outlines methods and
data correlations used to model the heat transfer to a heat
detector, as well as velocity and temperature correlations for
growing fires at the location of the detector. Only the general
principles are described here. More detailed information is
available in References 4, 9, 10, 16, and 28 in I.1.2.18.
B.3.3.3 Heat Detector Correlations.    The heat transfer to a
detector can be described by the following equation:
Q Q Q Qtotal cond conv rad= + +
where:
Qtotal = total heat transfer to a detector (kW or Btu/sec)
Qcond = conductive heat transfer
Qconv = convective heat transfer
Qrad = radiative heat transfer
B.3.3.3.1   Because detection typically occurs during the initial
stages of a fire, the radiant heat transfer component ( Qrad) can
be considered negligible. In addition, because the heat-sensing
elements of most of the heat detectors are thermally isolated
from the rest of the detection unit, as well as from the ceiling,
it can be assumed that the conductive portion of the heat
release rate (Qcond) is also negligible, especially when compared
to the convective heat transfer rate. Because the majority of the
heat transfer to the detection element is via convection, the
following equation can be used to calculate the total heat trans‐
fer:
Q Q H A T T c g d= = ( )conv −

where:
Qconv = convective heat transfer (kW or Btu/sec)
Hc = convective heat transfer coefficient for the detector
(kW/m2·°C or Btu/ft2·sec·°F)
A = surface area of the detector’s element (m2 or ft2)
Tg = temperature of fire gases at the detector (°C or °F)
Td = temperature rating, or set point, of the detector (°C or

B.3.3.3.2   Assuming the detection element can be treated as a
lumped mass ( m) (kg or lbm), its temperature change can be
defined as follows:

d =
where:
dTd/dt = change in temperature of detection element
(deg/sec)
Q = heat release rate (kW or Btu/sec)
m = detector element’s mass (kg or lbm)
c = detector element’s specific heat (kJ/kg·°C or Btu/
lbm·°F)
B.3.3.3.3   By inserting Equation B.3.3.3.2 into Equation
B.3.3.3.1, the change in temperature of the detection element
over time is expressed in Equation B.3.3.3.3.

Note that the variables are identified in Section B.7.
B.3.3.3.4   The use of a time constant (τ) was proposed by
Heskestad and Smith [8] in order to define the convective heat
transfer to a specific detector’s heat-sensing element. This time
constant is a function of the mass, specific heat, convective heat
transfer coefficient, and area of the element and can be
expressed as follows:
τ = mc
H Ac
where:
m = detector element’s mass (kg or lbm)
c = detector element’s specific heat (kJ/kg·°C or Btu/lbm ·
°F)
Hc = convective heat transfer coefficient for the detector
(kW/m2·°C or Btu/ft2·sec·°F)
A = surface area of the detector’s element (m2 or ft2)
τ = detector time constant (seconds)
B.3.3.3.5   As seen in the equation B.3.3.3.4, τ is a measure of
the detector’s sensitivity. By increasing the mass of the detec‐
tion element, the time constant, and thus the response time,
increases.
B.3.3.3.6   Substituting into equation B.3.3.3.3 produces the
following:

Note that the variables are identified in Section B.7.
B.3.3.3.7   Research has shown [24] that the convective heat
transfer coefficient for sprinklers and heat detection elements
is similar to that of spheres, cylinders, and so forth, and is thus
approximately proportional to the square root of the velocity of
the gases passing the detector. As the mass, thermal capacity,
and area of the detection element remain constant, the follow‐
ing relationship can be expressed as the response time index
(RTI) for an individual detector:
τ τ u u 1 2 
0 0 
1 2 / / =  RTI 
where:
τ = detector time constant (seconds)
u = velocity of fire gases (m/sec or ft/sec)
u0 = instantaneous velocity of fire gases (m/sec or ft/sec)
RTI = response time index
B.3.3.3.8   If τ0 is measured at a given reference velocity ( u0), τ
can be determined for any other gas velocity ( u) for that detec‐
tor. A plunge test is the easiest way to measure τ0. It has also
been related to the listed spacing of a detector through a calcu‐
lation. Table B.3.2.5 presents results from these calculations
[10]. The RTI value can then be obtained by multiplying τ0
values by u0
1
∕2.
B.3.3.3.9   It has become customary to refer to the time
constant using a reference velocity of u0 = 1.5 m/sec (5 ft/sec).
For example, where u0 = 1.5 m/sec (5 ft/sec), a τ0 of
30 seconds corresponds to an RTI of 36 sec
1
∕2/m
1
∕2 (or 67 sec
1
∕2/
ft
1
∕2). On the other hand, a detector that has an RTI of
36 sec
1
∕2/m
1
∕2 (or 67 sec
1
∕2/ft
1
∕2) would have a τ0 of 23.7 seconds, if
measured in an air velocity of 2.4 m/sec (8 ft/sec).
B.3.3.3.10   The following equation can therefore be used to
calculate the heat transfer to the detection element and thus
determine its temperature from its local fire-induced environ‐
ment:

B.3.3.4 Temperature and Velocity Correlations.    [26, 28] In
order to predict the operation of any detector, it is necessary to
characterize the local environment created by the fire at the
location of the detector. For a heat detector, the important vari‐
ables are the temperature and velocity of the gases at the detec‐
tor. Through a program of full-scale tests and the use of
mathematical modeling techniques, general expressions for
temperature and velocity at a detector location have been
developed by Heskestad and Delichatsios (refer to references 4, 9,

grow according to the following power law relationship:
Q t p= α
where:
Q = theoretical convective fire heat release rate (kW or
Btu/sec)
α = fire growth rate (kW/sec2 or Btu/sec3)
t = time (seconds)
p = positive exponent
Several other ceiling jet correlations [41] have been devel‐
oped over the years that the designer should also review as to
their applicability to the particular design case. Sensitivity anal‐
yses should also be conducted with the analysis.
B.3.3.4.1   Relationships have been developed by Heskestad

in a ceiling jet. These have been expressed as follows [26]:

B.3.3.4.2   Using the correlations in B.3.3.4.1, Heskestad and
Delichatsios [9], and with later updates from another paper by
Heskestad [11], the following correlations were presented for
fires that had heat release rates that grew according to the
power law equation, with p = 2. As previously discussed [10, 18],
the p = 2 power law fire growth model can be used to model
the heat release rate of a wide range of fuels. These fires are
therefore referred to as t-squared fires.

B.3.3.5 Limitations.    [26]
Δ B.3.3.5.1   If velocity and temperature of the fire gases flowing
past a detector cannot be accurately determined, errors will be
introduced when calculating the response of a detector. The
graphs presented by Heskestad and Delichatsios indicate the
errors in the calculated fire–gas temperatures and velocities
[10]. A detailed analysis of these errors is beyond the scope of
this annex; however, some discussion is warranted. In using the
method presented in B.3.3.2, the user should be aware of the
limitations of these correlations, as outlined in Reference 26.
The designer should also refer back to the original reports.
Graphs of actual and calculated data show that errors in T2
*
can be as high as 50 percent, although generally there appears
to be much better agreement. The maximum errors occur at
r/H values of about 0.37. All other plots of actual and calcula‐
ted data, for various r/H, show much smaller errors. In terms of
the actual change in temperature over ambient, the maximum
errors are on the order of 5°C to 10°C (9°F to 18°F). The
larger errors occur with faster fires and lower ceilings.
At r/H = 0.37, the errors are conservative when the equations
are used in a design problem. That is, the equations predicted
lower temperatures. Plots of data for other values of r/H indi‐
cate that the equations predict slightly higher temperatures.
Errors in fire–gas velocities are related to errors in tempera‐
tures. The equations show that the velocity of the fire gases is
proportional to the square root of the change in temperatures
of the fire gases. In terms of heat transfer to a detector, the
detector’s change in temperature is proportional to the change
in gas temperature and the square root of the fire–gas velocity.
Hence, the expected errors bear the same relationships.
Based on the discussion in this section, errors in predicted
temperatures and velocities of fire gases will be greatest for fast
fires and low ceilings. Sample calculations simulating these
conditions show errors in calculated detector spacings on the
order of plus or minus one meter, or less.
B.3.3.5.2   The procedures presented in this annex are based
on an analysis of test data for ceiling heights up to 9.1 m
(30 ft). No data were analyzed for ceilings greater than 9.1 m
(30 ft). The reader should refer to Reference 40 for additional
insight.
B.3.3.6 Design Examples.
B.3.3.6.1 Define Project Scope.    A fire detection system is to
be designed for installation in an unsprinklered warehouse
building. The building has a large, flat ceiling that is approxi‐
mately 4 m (13.1 ft) high. The ambient temperature inside is
normally 10°C (50°F). The municipal fire service has indicated
that it can begin putting water on the fire within 5.25 minutes
of receiving the alarm.
B.3.3.6.2 Identify Goals.    Provide protection of property.
B.3.3.6.3 Define Stakeholder’s Objective.   No fire spread from
initial fuel package.
B.3.3.6.4 Define Design Objective.   Prevent radiant ignition of
adjacent fuel package.
B.3.3.6.5 Develop Performance Criteria.    After discussions
with the plant fire brigade with regard to their capability and
analyzing the radiant energy levels necessary to ignite adjacent
fuel packages, it was determined that the fire should be detec‐
ted and suppression activities started prior to its reaching
10,000 kW (9478 Btu/sec).
B.3.3.6.6 Develop Fire Scenarios and the Design Fire.    Evalua‐
tion of the potential contents to be warehoused identified the
areas where wood pallets are stored to be one of the highest
fire hazards.
B.3.3.6.6.1   The fire scenario involving the ignition of a stack
of wood pallets will therefore be evaluated. The pallets are
stored 0.5 m (1.5 ft) high. Fire test data [see Table B.2.3.2.6.2(a)]
indicate that this type of fire follows the t2 power law equation
with a tg equal to approximately 150 to 310 seconds. To be
conservative, the faster fire growth rate will be used. Thus,
using Equation B.3.3.4,

B.3.3.7 Develop Candidate Designs.
B.3.3.7.1   Fixed-temperature heat detectors have been selected
for installation in the warehouse with a 57°C (135°F) operating
temperature and a UL-listed spacing of 9.1 m (30 ft). From
Table B.3.2.5, the time constant is determined to be 80 seconds
when referenced to a gas velocity of 1.5 m/sec (5 ft/sec). When
used with Equation B.3.3.3.7, the detector’s RTI can be calcula‐
ted as follows:
RTI = τ 0 0

RTI = 98 m1 2 1 2/ /sec
or

first guess at the required detector spacing. For this example, a
first estimate of 4.7 m (15.3 ft) is used. This correlates to a
radial distance of 3.3 m (10.8 ft).
B.3.3.8 Evaluate Candidate Designs.    These values can then be
entered into the design and analysis worksheet shown in Figure
B.3.3.8 in order to evaluate the candidate design.
B.3.3.8.1   After 146 seconds, when the fire has grown to
1000 kW (948 Btu/sec) and at a radial distance of 3.3 m
(10.8 ft) from the center of the fire, the detector temperature
is calculated to be 57°C (135°F). This is the detector actuation
temperature. If the calculated temperature of the detector
were higher than the actuation temperature, the radial
distance could be increased. The calculation would then be
repeated until the calculated detector temperature is approxi‐
mately equal to the actuation temperature.
B.3.3.8.2   The last step is to use the final calculated value of r
with the equation relating spacing to radial distance. This will
determine the maximum installed detector spacing that will
result in detector response within the established goals.
S r= 21 2 /
S = ( )4 7 .  m 15.3 ft
where:
S = spacing of detectors
r = radial distance from fire plume axis (m or ft)
B.3.3.8.3   The following example of analysis is provided.

[B.3.3.7.1a]
 
[B.3.3.7.1b]
 
[B.3.3.8.2]
B.3.3.8.3.1   The following example shows how an existing heat
detection system or a proposed design can be analyzed to
determine the response time or fire size at response. The
scenario that was analyzed in the previous example will be used
again, with the exception that the warehouse building has exist‐
ing heat detectors. The fire, building, and detectors have the
same characteristics as the previous example with the excep‐
tion of spacing. The detectors are spaced evenly on the ceiling
at 9.1 m (30 ft) intervals.
B.3.3.8.3.2   The following equation is used to determine the
maximum radial distance from the fire axis to a detector:
S r= 1 414 .
or
r S= 1 414 .
r = ( )6 5 .  m 21.2 ft
where:
S = spacing of detectors
r = radial distance from fire plume axis (m or ft)
B.3.3.8.3.3   Next, the response time of the detector or the fire
size at response is estimated. In the preceding design, the fire
grew to 1000 kW (948 Btu/sec) in 146 seconds when the detec‐
tor located at a distance of 3.3 m (10.8 ft) responded. As the
radial distance in this example is larger, a slower response time
and thus a larger fire size at response is expected. A first
approximation at the response time is made at 3 minutes. The
corresponding fire size is found using the power law fire
growth equation B.3.3.4 with p = 2 and α from B.3.3.6.6.1:
Q t p= α
Q = ( ) ( )0 047 180 2 2
. /sec kW  sec
Q = 1523 kW
or
Q = ( ) ( )0 044 180

.  Btu/sec  sec3
Q = 1426 Btu/sec
B.3.3.8.3.4   These data can be incorporated into the fire detec‐
tion design and analysis worksheet shown in Figure B.3.3.8.3.4
in order to carry out the remainder of the calculations.

B.3.3.8.3.5   Using a radial distance of 6.5 m (21 ft) from the
axis of this fire, the temperature of the detector is calculated to
be 41°C (106°F) after 3 minutes of exposure. The detector
actuation temperature is 57°C (135°F). Thus, the detector
response time is more than the estimated 3 minutes. If the
calculated temperature were more than the actuation tempera‐
ture, then a smaller t would be used. As in the previous exam‐
ple, calculations should be repeated varying the time to
response until the calculated detector temperature is approxi‐
mately equal to the actuation temperature. For this example,
the response time is estimated to be 213 seconds. This corre‐
sponds to a fire size at response of 2132 kW (2022 Btu/sec).
B.3.3.8.4   The preceding examples assume that the fire contin‐
ues to follow the t-squared fire growth relationship up to detec‐
tor activation. These calculations do not check whether this will
happen, nor do they show how the detector temperature varies
once the fire stops following the power law relationship. The
user should therefore determine that there will be sufficient
fuel, since the preceding correlations do not perform this anal‐
ysis. If there is not a sufficient amount of fuel, then there is the
possibility that the heat release rate curve will flatten out or
decline before the heat release rate needed for actuation is
reached.

B.3.3.9 Rate-of-Rise Heat Detector Spacing.
B.3.3.9.1   The preceding procedure can be used to estimate
the response of rate-of-rise heat detectors for either design or
analysis purposes. In this case, it is necessary to assume that the
heat detector response can be modeled using a lumped mass
heat transfer model.
B.3.3.9.2   In step 3 of Figure B.3.3.4.4, Figure B.3.3.8, and
Figure B.3.3.8.3.4, the user must determine the rate of temper‐
ature rise (dTd/dt) at which the detector will respond from the
manufacturer’s data. [Note that listed rate-of-rise heat detectors
are designed to actuate at a nominal rate of temperature rise of
8°C (15°F) per minute.] The user must use the relationship for
dTd(t)/dt in Equation B.3.3.4.3b instead of the relationship for
Td(t) - Td(0) in Equation B.3.3.4.3a in order to calculate the rate
of change of the detector temperature. This value is then
compared to the rate of change at which the chosen detector is
designed to respond.
NOTE: The assumption that heat transfer to a detector can
be modeled as a lumped mass might not hold for rate-of-rise
heat detectors. This is due to the operating principle of this
type of detector, in that most rate-of-rise detectors operate
when the expansion of air in a chamber expands at a rate faster
than it can vent through an opening. To accurately model the
response of a rate-of-rise detector would require modeling the
heat transfer from the detector body to the air in the chamber,
as well as the air venting through the hole.

However, a conservative approach to predicting their perform‐
ance is to use the fixed-temperature heat detector guidance
contained herein.
B.4 Smoke Detector Spacing for Flaming Fires.
B.4.1 Introduction.
B.4.1.1   The listing investigation for smoke detectors does not
yield a “listed spacing” as it does for heat detectors. Instead, the
manufacturers recommend a spacing. Because the largest spac‐
ing that can be evaluated in the full-scale fire test room is 7.6 m
(25 ft), it has become common practice to recommend 9.1 m
(30 ft) spacing for smoke detectors when they are installed on
flat, smooth ceilings. Reductions in smoke detector spacing are
made empirically to address factors that can affect response,
including ceiling height, beamed or joisted ceilings, and areas
that have high rates of air movement.
B.4.1.2   The placement of smoke detectors, however, should
be based on an understanding of fire plume and ceiling jet
flows, smoke production rates, particulate changes due to
aging, and the operating characteristics of the particular detec‐
tor being used. The heat detector spacing information presen‐
ted in Section B.3 is based on knowledge of plume and jet
flows. An understanding of smoke production and aging lags
considerably behind an understanding of heat production. In
addition, the operating characteristics of smoke detectors in
specific fire environments are not often measured or made
generally available for other than a very few number of
combustible materials. Therefore, the existing knowledge base
precludes the development of complete engineering design
information for smoke detector location and spacing.
B.4.1.3   In design applications where predicting the response
of smoke detectors is not critical, the spacing criteria presented
in Chapter 17 should provide sufficient information to design a
very basic smoke detection system. However, if the goals and
objectives established for the detection system require detector
response within a certain amount of time, optical density, heat
release rate, or temperature rise, then additional analysis might
be needed. For these situations, information regarding the
expected fire characteristics (fuel and its fire growth rate),
transport characteristics, detector characteristics, and compart‐
ment characteristics is required. The following information
regarding smoke detector response and various performance-
based approaches to evaluating smoke detector response is
therefore provided.
B.4.2 Response Characteristics of Smoke Detectors.   To deter‐
mine whether a smoke detector will respond to a given QCR, a
number of factors need to be evaluated. These factors include
smoke characteristics, smoke transport, and detector character‐
istics.
B.4.3 Smoke Characteristics.
B.4.3.1   Smoke characteristics are a function of the fuel
composition, the mode of combustion (smoldering or flam‐
ing), and the amount of mixing with the ambient air (dilu‐
tion). These factors are important for determining the
characteristics of the products of combustion, such as particle
size, distribution, composition, concentration, refractive index,
and so on. The significance of these features with regard to
smoke detector response is well documented. [29, 30]

B.4.3.2   Whether smoke detectors detect by sensing scattered
light, loss of light transmission (light extinction), or reduction
of ion current, they are particle detectors. Thus, particle
concentration, size, color, size distribution, and so forth, affect
each sensing technology differently. It is generally accepted
that a flaming, well-ventilated, energetic fire produces smoke
having a larger proportion of the sub-micron diameter particu‐
lates as opposed to a smoldering fire that produces smoke with
a predominance of large, super-micron particulates. It is also
known that as the smoke cools, the smaller particles agglomer‐
ate, forming larger ones as they age, and are carried away from
the fire source. More research is necessary to provide sufficient
data to allow the prediction of smoke characteristics at the
source, as well as during transport. Furthermore, response
models must be developed that can predict the response of a
particular detector to different kinds of smoke as well as smoke
that has aged during the flow from the fire to the detector loca‐
tion.
B.4.4 Transport Considerations.
B.4.4.1   All smoke detection relies on the plume and ceiling jet
flows to transport the smoke from the locus of the fire to the
detector. Various considerations must be addressed during this
transport time, including changes to the characteristics of the
smoke that occur with time and distance from the source, and
transport time of smoke from the source to the detector.
B.4.4.2   The smoke characteristic changes that occur during
transport relate mainly to the particle size distribution. Particle
size changes during transport occur mainly as a result of sedi‐
mentation and agglomeration.
B.4.4.3   Transport time is a function of the characteristics of
the travel path from the source to the detector. Important char‐
acteristics that should be considered include ceiling height and
configuration (e.g., sloped, beamed), intervening barriers such
as doors and beams, as well as dilution and buoyancy effects
such as stratification that might delay or prevent smoke in
being transported to the detector.
B.4.4.4   In smoldering fires, thermal energy provides a force
for transporting smoke particles to the smoke sensor. However,
usually in the context of smoke detection, the rate of energy
(heat) release is small and the rate of growth of the fire is slow.
Consequently, other factors such as ambient airflow from
HVAC systems, differential solar heating of the structure, and
wind cooling of the structure can have a dominant influence
on the transport of smoke particles to the smoke sensor when
low-output fires are considered.
B.4.4.5   In the early stages of development of a growing fire,
the same interior environmental effects, including ambient
airflow from HVAC systems, differential solar heating of the
structure, and wind cooling of the structure, can have a domi‐
nant influence on the transport of smoke. This is particularly
important in spaces having high ceilings. Greater thermal
energy release from the fire is necessary to overcome these
interior environmental effects. Because the fire must attain a
sufficiently high level of heat release before it can overcome
the interior environmental airflows and drive the smoke to the
ceiling-mounted detectors, the use of closer spacing of smoke
detectors on the ceiling might not significantly improve the
response of the detectors to the fire. Therefore, when consider‐
ing ceiling height alone, smoke detector spacing closer than
9.1 m (30 ft) might not be warranted, except in instances
where an engineering analysis indicates additional benefit will
result. Other construction characteristics also should be consid‐
ered. (Refer to the appropriate sections of Chapter 17 dealing with
smoke detectors and their use for the control of smoke spread.)
B.4.5 Smoke Dilution.    Smoke dilution causes a reduction in
the quantity of smoke per unit of air volume of smoke reaching
the detector. Dilution typically occurs either by entrainment of
air in the plume or the ceiling jet or by effects of HVAC
systems. Forced ventilation systems with high air change rates
typically cause the most concern, particularly in the early stages
of fire development, when smoke production rate and plume
velocity are both low. Airflows from supply as well as return
vents can create defined air movement patterns within a
compartment, which can either keep smoke away from detec‐
tors that are located outside of these paths or can inhibit
smoke from entering a detector that is located directly in the
airflow path. [26]
There currently are no quantitative methods for estimating
either smoke dilution or airflow effects on locating smoke
detectors. These factors should therefore be considered quali‐
tatively. The designer should understand that the effects of
airflow become larger as the fire size at detection ( QCR) gets
smaller. Depending on the application, the designer might find
it useful to obtain airflow and velocity profiles within the room
or to even conduct small-scale smoke tests under various condi‐
tions to assist in the design of the system.
B.4.6 Stratification.
B.4.6.1   The potential for the stratification of smoke is another
concern in designing and analyzing the response of detectors.
This is of particular concern with the detection of low-energy
fires and fires in compartments with high ceilings.
B.4.6.2   The upward movement of smoke in the plume
depends on the smoke being buoyant relative to the surround‐
ing air. Stratification occurs when the smoke or hot gases flow‐
ing from the fire fail to ascend to the smoke detectors mounted
at a particular level (usually on the ceiling) above the fire due
to the loss of buoyancy. This phenomenon occurs due to the
continuous entrainment of cooler air into the fire plume as it
rises, resulting in cooling of the smoke and fire plume gases.
The cooling of the plume results in a reduction in buoyancy.
Eventually the plume cools to a point where its temperature
equals that of the surrounding air and its buoyancy diminishes
to zero. Once this point of equilibrium is reached, the smoke
will cease its upward flow and form a layer, maintaining its
height above the fire, regardless of the ceiling height, unless
and until sufficient additional thermal energy is provided from
the fire to raise the layer due to its increased buoyancy. The
maximum height to which plume fluid (smoke) will ascend,
especially early in the development of a fire, depends on the
convective heat release rate of the fire and the ambient temper‐
ature in the compartment.
B.4.6.3   Because warm air rises, there will usually be a tempera‐
ture gradient in the compartment. Of particular interest are
those cases where the temperature of the air in the upper
portion of the compartment is greater than at the lower level
before the ignition. This can occur as a result of solar load
where ceilings contain glazing materials. Computational meth‐
ods are available to assess the potential for intermediate stratifi‐
cation for the following two cases, depicted in Figure
B.4.6.3(a).

Case 1. The temperature of the ambient is relatively constant
up to a height above which there is a layer of warm air at
uniform temperature. This situation can occur if the upper
portion of a mall, atrium, or other large space is unoccupied
and the air is left unconditioned.
Case 2.  The ambient interior air of the compartment has a
constant and uniform temperature gradient (temperature
change per unit height) from floor to ceiling. This case is
generally encountered in industrial and storage facilities that
are normally unoccupied.
The analysis of intermediate stratification is presented in
Figure B.4.6.3(b). Plume centerline temperatures from two
fires, 1000 kW (948 Btu/sec) and 2000 kW (1896 Btu/sec), are
graphed based on estimates from correlations presented in this
section. In Case 1, a step function is assumed to indicate a
30°C/m (16.5°F/ft) change in temperature 15 m (49.2 ft)
above the floor due to the upper portion of the atrium being
unconditioned. For Case 2, a temperature gradient of 1.5°C/m
(0.82°F/ft) is arbitrarily assumed in an atrium that has a ceiling
height of 20 m (65.6 ft).
B.4.6.3.1 Step Function Temperature Gradient Spaces.    If the
interior air temperature exhibits a discrete change at some
elevation above the floor, the potential for stratification can be
assessed by applying the plume centerline temperature correla‐
tion. If the plume centerline temperature is equal to the ambi‐
ent temperature, the plume is no longer buoyant, loses its
upward momentum, and stratifies at that height. The plume
centerline temperature can be calculated by using the follow‐
ing equation:

Btu/sec)
B.4.6.3.2.1   The convective portion of the heat release rate
(Qc) can be estimated as 70 percent of the heat release rate.
B.4.6.3.2.2   As an alternative to using the noted expression to
directly calculate the maximum height to which the smoke or
heat will rise, Figure B.4.6.3.2.2 can be used to determine Zm
for given fires. Where Zm, as calculated or determined graphi‐
cally, is greater than the installed height of detectors, smoke or
heat from a rising fire plume is predicted to reach the detec‐
tors. Where the compared values of Zm and the installed height
of detectors are comparable heights, the prediction that smoke
or heat will reach the detectors might not be a reliable expecta‐
tion.
B.4.6.3.2.3   Assuming the ambient temperature varies linearly
with the height, the minimum Qc required to overcome the
ambient temperature difference and drive the smoke to the

B.4.6.3.2.4   The theoretical basis for the stratification calcula‐

and Heskestad [9]. For further information regarding the deri‐
vation of the expression defining Zm, the user is referred to the
work of Klote and Milke [13] and NFPA 92.
B.4.7 Detector Characteristics.
B.4.7.1 General.    Once smoke is transported to the detector,
additional factors become important in determining whether
response will occur. These include the aerodynamic character‐
istics of the detector and the type of sensor within the detector.
The aerodynamics of the detector relate to how easily smoke
can pass through the detector housing and enter the sensor
portion of the unit. Additionally, the location of the entry
portion to the sensor with respect to the velocity profile of the
ceiling jet is also an important factor. Finally, different sensing
methods (e.g., ionization or photoelectric) will respond differ‐
ently, depending on the smoke characteristics (smoke color,
particle size, optical density, and so forth). Within the family of
photoelectric devices, there will be variations depending on the
wavelengths of light and the scattering angles employed. The
following paragraphs discuss some of these issues and various
calculation methods.
B.4.7.2 Resistance to Smoke Entry.
B.4.7.2.1   All spot-type smoke detectors require smoke to enter
the detection chamber in order to be sensed. This requires
additional factors to be taken into consideration when attempt‐
ing to estimate smoke detector response, as smoke entry into
the detection chamber can be affected in several ways, for
example, insect screens, sensing chamber configuration, and
location of the detector with respect to the ceiling.
B.4.7.2.2   In trying to quantify this, Heskestad [32] developed
the idea of smoke detector lag to explain the difference in opti‐
cal density outside ( Dur) versus inside ( Duo) of a detector when

the detector actuates. It was demonstrated that this difference
could be explained by the use of a correction factor Duc using
the following relationship:
D
L d D
dt
V
uc
u
=
( )
where:
L = characteristic length for a given detector design,
represents the ease of smoke entry into the sensing
chamber
d(Du)/dt = rate of increase of optical density outside the detec‐
tor
V = velocity of the smoke at the detector
B.4.7.2.3   Various studies regarding this correlation have provi‐
ded additional insight regarding smoke entry and associated
lags [33, 34, 34a, 34b, 34c, 34d, 34e]; however, the difficulty in
quantifying L for different detectors and relating it to spacing
requirements can have limited usefulness, and the concept of
critical velocity (uc) could be more applicable. [21]
B.4.7.3 Critical Velocity.   A smoke detector’s critical velocity
refers to the minimum velocity of the smoke necessary to enter
the sensing chamber to cause an alarm without significant
delays due to smoke entry lag. Alarms can occur at velocities
less than the critical velocity value, but their response can be
delayed or require greater smoke concentrations than would
normally be necessary. Flow across a detector causes a pressure
differential between the upstream and downstream sides of the
detector. This pressure differential is the principal driving force
for the smoke entering the unit.
Experimental work has indicated that the critical velocity is
approximately 0.15 m/sec (0.49 ft/sec) for the ionization
detectors tested in one particular study. [21] Once velocities
were reduced below this level, the smoke concentration level
outside the detector before an alarm condition increased
dramatically when compared to smoke concentration levels
when the velocity was above the critical value. Another study
found that measured velocities at the time of alarm for ioniza‐
tion and photoelectric detectors in full-scale flaming fire tests
generally supported this velocity value, with a mean value of
0.13 m/sec (0.43 ft/sec) and a standard deviation of
0.07 m/sec (0.23 ft/sec) [46]. Estimating the critical velocity
can therefore be useful for design and analysis.
It is interesting to note that this critical velocity value
(0.15 m/sec or 0.49 ft/sec) is close to that at which a smoke
detector must respond in the UL smoke detector sensitivity
chamber in order to become listed. [35] The location in the
ceiling jet where this velocity occurs for a given fire and ceiling
height might therefore be considered as a first approximation
for locating detectors. This again assumes a horizontal, smooth
ceiling. Care should also be taken when using this correlation,
such that consideration is given to potential effects of coagula‐
tion and agglomeration, and settling of the smoke within the
ceiling jet as it moves away from the fire source and loses its
buoyancy. The velocity for smoke entry might be present, but
the concentration of smoke might not be sufficient to actuate
the detector.

B.4.7.4 Response to Smoke Color.    Smoke detectors that use
an optical means to detect smoke respond differently to
smokes of different colors.
B.4.7.4.1   Manufacturers currently provide limited information
regarding the response of smoke detectors in their specifica‐
tions as well as in the information contained on the labels on
the backs of the detectors. This response information indicates
only their nominal response values with respect to gray smoke,
not to black, and is often provided with a response range
instead of an exact response value. This range is in accordance
with ANSI/UL 268, Standard for Smoke Detectors for Fire Alarm
Systems.
B.4.7.4.2   The response ranges allowable by UL for gray smoke
are shown in Table B.4.7.4.2. Older editions of ANSI/UL 268
contained response ranges for black smoke and are also shown
for comparison.
B.4.7.4.3   Detectors respond at different optical density levels
to different fuels and different types of smoke. Examples of this
are shown in Table B.4.7.4.3, which contains values of optical
density at response recommended by Heskestad and Delichat‐
sios [10] based on their test.
Table B.4.7.4.2 ANSI/UL 268 Smoke Detector Test
Acceptance Criteria for Different Colored Smoke [35]
Color of Smoke  
Acceptable Response Range
%/m %/ft
Gray 1.6–12.5 0.5–4.0
Black 5.0–29.2 1.5–10.0
Note the large variations in response not only to materials
producing relatively the same color of smoke but also to smoke
of different color, which is much more pronounced. Also note
that there was variation in the optical density at response values
for a given material in the test conducted by Heskestad and
Delichatsios, which is not shown in Table B.4.7.4.3. The values
cited in Table B.4.7.4.3 are provided as an example of the varia‐
tion in optical density at response, but these values are not
necessarily appropriate for all analyses. For example, the results
presented for polyurethane and PVC involved relatively large,
rapidly developing fires, and fires with smaller growth rates
could result in smaller values of optical density at response
[10]. More information on the variation of optical density at
response is available from Geiman and Gottuk [48] and
Geiman [46].
B.4.7.5 Optical Density and Temperature.    During a flaming
fire, smoke detector response is affected by ceiling height and
the size and rate of fire growth in much the same way as heat
detector response. The thermal energy of the flaming fire
transports smoke particles to the sensing chamber just as it
does heat to a heat sensor. While the relationship between the
amount of smoke and the amount of heat produced by a fire is
highly dependent on the fuel and the way it is burning,
research has shown that the relationship between temperature
and the optical density of smoke remains somewhat constant
within the fire plume and on the ceiling in the proximity of the
plume.
B.4.7.5.1   These results were based on the work by Heskestad
and Delichatsios [10] and are indicated in Table B.4.7.5.1.
Note that for a given fuel, the optical density to temperature
rise ratio between the maximum and minimum levels is 10 or
less.

B.4.7.5.2   In situations where the optical density at detector
response is known and is independent of particle size distribu‐
tion, the detector response can be approximated as a function
of the heat release rate of the burning fuel, the fire growth
rate, and the ceiling height, assuming that the preceding corre‐
lation exists.
B.4.7.5.3   When Appendix C of NFPA 72E [58] was first
published in 1984, a 13°C (20°F) temperature rise was used to
indicate detector response. Schifiliti and Pucci [18] have
combined some of the data from Heskestad and Delichatsios
[10] to produce Table B.4.7.5.3 showing the temperature rise
at detector response. Note that the temperature rise associated
with detector response varies significantly depending on the
detector type and fuel.
Also note that the values in Table B.4.7.5.3 are not based on
temperature measurements taken at the detector response
times, but were calculated by Heskestad and Delichatsios [10]
from their recommended values of optical density at response
(Table B.4.7.4.3) and their recommended ratios of optical
density to temperature rise (Table B.4.7.5.1).
Several experimental studies have cited temperature rises at
detection as low as 1°C to 3°C (1.8°F to 5.4°F). Of particular
note, Geiman [46] found that for flaming fires, 80 percent of
the ionization detectors examined in full-scale smoke detection
tests alarmed at measured temperature rises less than or equal
to 3°C (5.4°F).
B.4.8 Methods for Estimating Smoke Detector Response.
B.4.8.1 General.    There are various methods to estimate
smoke detector response. Research is still needed in this area
to reflect smoke production, transport to the detector,
response of the detector, and performance metrics of the
smoke detector. Designers should be aware of the advantages
and disadvantages, as well as limitations, of these methods and
undertake sensitivity analyses and use of multiple methods
where applicable.
B.4.8.1.1 Method 1 — Optical Density Versus Temperature.
B.4.8.1.2   The following example is intended to determine
whether an existing fire detection system can detect a fire in
part of a warehouse used to store wardrobes in sufficient time
to prevent radiant ignition of adjacent wardrobes. The area
under review has a large, flat ceiling, 5 m (16.5 ft) high. The
ambient temperature within the compartment is 20°C (68°F).
The compartment is not sprinklered. The wardrobes are
constructed mainly of particleboard. The detectors are
ionization-type smoke detectors spaced 6.1 m (20 ft) on center.

Polyurethane 7.2 13 7.2 13
PVC 7.2 13 7.2 13
Average 7.8 14 21.1 38
The design objective is to keep the maximum heat release rate
(QDO) below 2 MW (1897 Btu/sec) in order to ensure that radi‐
ant ignition of the wardrobes in the adjacent aisle will not
occur. There is an on-site fire brigade that can respond to and
begin discharging water on the fire within 90 seconds of receiv‐
ing the alarm. It can be assumed that there are no other delays
between the time the detector reaches its operating threshold
and the time to notification of the fire brigade. Given this
information, would the existing system be sufficient?
B.4.8.1.3   The following assumptions are made for this exam‐
ple:

Temperature rise for response = 14°C (25°F)
Refer to Table B.4.7.5.3 for temperature rise to response of
an ionization smoke detector for a wood fire.
B.4.8.1.4   Using the power law equation, the design objective
response time is calculated as follows:

B.4.8.1.5   Next, subtract the time for the fire brigade to
respond to determine what time after ignition that detection
should occur. Note that a 30-second safety factor has been
added to the fire brigade’s response time.
tCR = 210 sec  120 sec = 90 sec−

B.4.8.1.7   Using the numbers in the fire detection design and
analysis worksheet at 90 seconds into the fire when the heat
release rate is 380 kW (360 Btu/sec), the temperature rise at
the detector is calculated to be approximately 17°C (30.6°F).
This, therefore, might be a reasonable approximation to show
that the detector might respond.
B.4.8.2 Method 2 — Mass Optical Density.
B.4.8.2.1   Data regarding smoke characteristics for given fuels
can be used as another method to evaluate detector response.
B.4.8.2.2   The following example is provided.
The design objective established for this scenario is to detect
the smoke from a flaming 400 g (1.0 lb) polyurethane chair
cushion in less than 2 minutes. The chair is placed in a
compartment that is 40 m2 (431 ft2). The ceiling height is 3.0 m
(10 ft). It has been determined that the burning rate of the
cushion is a steady rate of 50 g/min (0.09 lb/min). Determine
whether the design objective will be met.
B.4.8.2.3   The total mass loss of the cushion due to combus‐
tion at 2 minutes is 100 g (0.22 lb). Therefore, the optical
density in the room produced by the burning cushion can be
calculated from the following equation: [5]
D D M
V
m
c
=
where:
Dm = mass optical density (m2/g) [26]
M = mass (g)
Vc = volume of the compartment
D = [(0.22 m2/g)(100 g)]/(40 m2)(3 m) = 0.183 m-1
or where:
Dm = mass optical density (ft2/lb) [26]
M = mass (lb)
Vc = volume of the compartment
D = [(1075 ft2/lb)(0.22 lb)]/(431 ft2)(9.8 ft) = 0.056 ft−1
B.4.8.2.4   If it is assumed that the detector responds at an opti‐
cal density of 0.15 m -1 (0.046 ft -1), the maximum black smoke
optical density allowed in a previous edition of the ANSI/
UL 268 sensitivity test [35], it can be assumed that the detector
will respond within 2 minutes.
B.4.8.2.5   It should be noted that this method presents a very
simplified approach, and that various assumptions would need
to be made including that the smoke is confined to the room,
is well mixed, can reach the ceiling, and can enter the detector.
B.4.8.2.6   The preceding estimation assumes that the smoke is
evenly distributed throughout the entire compartment volume.
This is rarely the case but establishes a very conservative limit.
For design purposes, one can model the smoke layer as a cylin‐
drical volume centered about the fire plume having a depth
 
[B.4.8.2.3]
equivalent to the ceiling jet thickness or some multiple of it.
Refer to Figure B.4.8.2.6.
The volume of the cylinder can now be used as the solution

V r hc = π 2
To obtain the maximum radius from the fire plume center-
line at which detector response is expected, the nominal
0.14 m-1 optical density criterion is substituted into the relation
and an explicit relation for r is obtained,

Note that the results of this calculation are highly dependent
upon the assumed layer thickness, h. The designer must care‐
fully document the value used for the ceiling jet thickness for
this reason. This method does not assume any minimum veloc‐
ity across the detector, nor does it provide for any delay due to
smoke entry. Finally, it assumes uniform smoke concentration
throughout the solution volume. Failure to use prudently selec‐
ted values for ceiling jet thickness and use of this relation
outside the limitations imposed by the assumptions can lead to
invalid designs.
B.4.8.2.7   The mass optical density method also enables the
designer to analyze existing systems. When we accept the
assumption that smoke detectors listed by UL will respond at
an optical density of 0.14 m-1, we can write the relation:

This time estimate must be corrected for the lag time
produced by the resistance to smoke entry of the detector.
Currently, this time delay, which is a function of detector
design and ceiling jet velocity, is not quantified in the listing
process. Consequently, the designer must make an estimate of
the time delay due to smoke entry, te. Thus, the response time

This relation predicts the time at which the mass optical

dependent upon the assumed ceiling jet layer thickness.
However, once time, t, is known, if the fire can be characterized
as a t-square fire, the fire size can be calculated from the rela‐

This relation provides an estimate of detector response

to generate it.
B.4.8.3 Critical Velocity Method.   Research shows that a mini‐
mum critical velocity is necessary before smoke can enter the
sensing chamber of the smoke detector. (See B.4.7.3.) This
method assumes that, if this critical velocity has been attained,
sufficient smoke concentration is in the ceiling jet gas flow to
produce an alarm signal. Ceiling jet velocity correlations exist
for steady-state fires, not t-square fires. However, a t-square fire
can be modeled as a succession of steady-state fires for slow and
medium growth rate fires. In the UL smoke box test, the mini‐
mum flow velocity at the detector is 0.152 m/sec (30 ft/
minute). The correlation

This relation is solved to obtain the maximum distance
between the fire plume centerline and the detector at which
the critical jet velocity is expected to be obtained for the given
convective heat release rate and ceiling height.
B.4.9 Projected Beam Smoke Detection.
B.4.9.1   Projected beam smoke detection is often used in large
open spaces with high ceilings where the use of spot-type detec‐
tors is impractical due to the problems of smoke stratification.
In these spaces, there is questionable basis for the use of the
prescriptive spacings presented in Section 17.7. However,
beams can be installed such that, regardless of the fire origin,
the plume will intersect at least one beam. To employ this strat‐
egy, the plume divergence is calculated as a function of the alti‐
tude at which the projected beam detectors are installed. The
region of relatively uniform temperature and smoke density in
a buoyant plume diverges at an angle of approximately
22 degrees, as shown in Figure B.4.9.1.

Another method involves assessing the smoke obstruction
through the plume to determine the reduction in light from
the receiver to the transmitter of the beam-type smoke detector
to determine whether the detector might respond. [47]
B.4.10 Effects of HVAC Systems.   The requirement to address
the effects of HVAC systems on the performance of smoke
detectors was historically reduced to a “3-foot rule.” However,
research conducted under the auspices of the Fire Protection
Research Foundation showed that such a simple rule was not
adequate in many cases.
Theoretically, the effect of HVAC flows on the performance
of smoke detectors can be implemented by calculating the flow
velocity and smoke concentration at the detector as a function
of fire growth and HVAC operating parameters. With complex
ceilings this often requires the use of computational fluid
dynamics models running in computers. One such model is
FDS, developed and supported by NIST.
However, for simple, planar ceilings at heights customarily
encountered in conventional construction, the effects of HVAC
system can be estimated using a simplified calculation derived
from well-known correlations to identify where a problem is
likely. These simple calculations are not a substitute for a fully
modeled scenario, but they provide the advantage of being
easily executed in a short time frame.
Ceiling-mounted HVAC system supply and return registers
are designed to produce specific airflow patterns. The exact
shape of the velocity and flow volume profiles is determined by
the physical design of the register. A commercially available
register might exhibit a flow profile as shown in Figure B.4.10.
This section considers two cases. The first is where the ceil‐
ing jet is being acted upon by an HVAC system supply. The
second is where the ceiling jet is being acted upon by an HVAC
system return. Each case is considered in its bounding value
condition to provide a worst-case estimate of the resulting
velocity at the detector.
In the first case, the flow of air from the ceiling supply can
divert, impede, and dilute the ceiling jet flow, retarding detec‐
tor response. This effect can be estimated using a one-
dimensional vector analysis of the velocity produced by the
HVAC system versus that produced by the fire. The velocity
profile produced by the HVAC supply register is determined by
the design of the register and the flow volume supplied to it.
The velocity at the detector produced by the fire is an artifact

of the ceiling jet. The sum of these two velocities versus the
minimum velocity for response can be used to determine if
sufficient ceiling jet velocity exists at the detector to initiate an
alarm.
In the second case, the HVAC return pulls air up from lower
elevations in the compartment, diluting the smoke density in
the ceiling jet in the vicinity of the HVAC return. This case is
much more difficult to evaluate because it implies a flow
volume analysis to determine when the flow to ceiling-mounted
HVAC returns will distort the concentration profile of the ceil‐
ing jet to the point that it adversely affects detector response.
Unfortunately, the listings of smoke detectors do not include
an explicit measurable value for detector sensitivity in terms
that can relate to the design fire.
B.4.10.1 Effects of HVAC Ceiling Supply Registers.    This
method makes use of the finding that there is a critical mini‐
mum velocity necessary for reliable smoke detector response.
The use of the 30 ft/min (0.15 m/sec) flow velocity in the
UL 268 and 217 smoke detector sensitivity test for spot-type
smoke detectors has led to the evolution of spot-type smoke
detectors that are optimized for that flow velocity. In listing
investigations, it has been learned that when the ceiling jet
velocity is less than the nominal 30 ft/min (0.15 m/sec)
commercially available, listed spot-type smoke detector,
performance begins to suffer. (See B.4.7.3.)
For the prediction of spot-type smoke detector response we
assume that the ceiling jet velocity at the detector must exceed
this critical velocity, 0.15 m/sec (30 ft/min), at the detector.
The flow from an HVAC system supply register also produces a
flow velocity. When a fire occurs in a room equipped with
ceiling-mounted HVAC system supply, the velocity at the detec‐
tor is the vector sum of the velocity due to the HVAC system
supply and the fire ceiling jet.
To estimate the resultant flow velocity at a smoke detector,
the flow velocity from the ceiling supply is determined as a
function of register design, flow volume, and distance from the
supply register. The velocity produced by the ceiling jet is calcu‐
lated as a function of distance from the fire plume. The worst-
case limit condition is where the detector location is where the
ceiling jet flow is directly opposite in direction to the flow from
the HVAC supply register. Consequently, it is assumed that the
ceiling jet is flowing in the opposite direction of the flow from
the ceiling register.
The flow of air into a compartment via the HVAC system can
be estimated by the flow volume and a flow factor that is rela‐
ted to the flow characteristics of the supply register. See Figure
B.4.10.1(a) for an example of such characteristics.
The manufacturer of the ceiling supply register provides a
velocity diagram that depicts flow velocity as a function of flow

volume for each register it produces. In the U.S., these
diagrams generally use conventional feet per minute (FPM)
and cubic feet per minute (CFM) units. Since fire protection
engineering correlations are generally expressed in metric
units, it is necessary to convert the flow volume and flow veloc‐
ity from the HVAC system to metric units. Replacing CFM with
flow volume per unit time this relation becomes:
v k V dr = ( )/ 2  m/sec
where:
vr = is the velocity due to the register
The ceiling jet velocity can be modeled with the relation for
critical velocity developed by Alpert.
v Q H rd c= ( )0 195 1 3 1 2 5 6. / / /  m/sec
The flow at the detector is the sum of the velocity from the
ceiling jet and the ceiling supply register. Since the worst-case
scenario is where the fire is located such that the flow of the
ceiling jet is directly opposed to the flow from the HVAC supply
register, this scenario forms the basis for the analysis as shown
in Figure B.4.10.1(b).
The velocity from the ceiling jet is derived from Alpert’s
correlations.
v Q H rd c= ( )0 195 1 3 1 2 5 6. / / /
where:
vd = ceiling jet velocity at the detector
Qc = convective heat release, 0.65 Q
H = ceiling height
r = radius, distance between plume centerline and the detec‐
tor
All in metric units.
In the case of opposing flows, the resultant velocity at the
detector is the ceiling jet velocity minus the velocity due to the
flow from the HVAC supply. The relation becomes:
v Q H r k V dd c= ( ) − ( )0 195 1 3 1 2 5 6 2. / / / / /
Smoke detector response can be expected to be consistent
with its listing when the value of vd is greater than or equal to
0.15 m/sec. Thus the relation becomes:
0 15 0 195 1 3 1 2 5 6 2. . / / / / / m/sec ≤ ( ) − ( )Q H r k CFM dc
If the right-hand side of the equation B.4.10.1e exceeds the
left, the airflow from the HVAC register should not be suffi‐
cient to reduce the ceiling jet flow from the fire plume to the
point where response by a smoke detector would not be expec‐

ted. On the other hand, if the calculated resultant velocity is
less than the 0.15 m/sec threshold, adjustments should be
made to the design to locate the smoke detector where there
will be sufficient ceiling jet velocity to predict alarm response.
B.4.10.2 Effects of HVAC Returns.    When detectors are in
close proximity to ceiling-mounted HVAC return grilles, the
flow of air upward toward the return grille tends to dilute and
cool the ceiling jet. This tends to retard the response of detec‐
tors. Unfortunately the geometry is more complex in this case.
The ceiling jet is moving horizontally across the ceiling while
the flow toward a ceiling-mounted return grille is essentially
moving vertically.
Most ceiling return grilles usually exhibit a flow velocity
profile that is roughly hemispherical in shape, centered on the
duct centerline. Figure B.4.10.2 illustrates this flow velocity
profile.
As the radial distance from the HVAC return increases, the
velocity drops off quite rapidly, proportional to 4 π times the
square of the increase in distance. The relative velocity contri‐
butions could be again used to calculate the relative effect, but
in this case an explicit sensitivity parameter that relates to the
design fire is not available. Percent per foot obscuration cannot
be reliably used.

However, the bounding value, worst-case scenario is where
the upward velocity is modeled as if it is flowing directly oppo‐
site to that of the ceiling jet. This reduces to the same analysis
as for the ceiling supply.
These calculations do NOT replace CFD modeling. They are
limited only for level ceilings of heights normally encountered
in commercial construction. In that limited context they can be
used to predict smoke detector performance.
B.5 Radiant Energy Detection.
B.5.1 General.
B.5.1.1 Electromagnetic Radiation.   Electromagnetic radiation
is emitted over a broad range of the spectrum during the
combustion process. The portion of the spectrum in which
radiant energy–sensing detectors operate has been divided into
three bands: ultraviolet (UV), visible, or infrared (IR). These
wavelengths are defined with the following wavelength ranges:
[3]
(1) Ultraviolet 0.1–0.35 microns
(2) Visible 0.35–0.75 microns
(3) Infrared 0.75–220 microns
B.5.1.2 Wavelength.    These wavelength ranges correspond to
the quantum-mechanical interaction between matter and
energy. Photonic interactions with matter can be characterized
by wavelength as shown in Table B.5.1.2.
B.5.1.3 Photon Transfer.   When a fuel molecule is oxidized in
the combustion process, the combustion intermediate mole‐
cule must lose energy to become a stable molecular species.
This energy is emitted as a photon with a unique wavelength
determined by the following equation:
e hc= λ
where:
e = energy (joules)
h = Planck’s constant (6.63E-23 joule-sec)
c = speed of light (m/sec)
λ = wavelength (microns)
[1.0 joule = 5.0345E+18( λ), where λ is measured in
microns.]
B.5.1.4 Type of Detector.    The choice of the type of radiant
energy–sensing detector to use is determined by the type of
emissions that are expected from the fire radiator.
B.5.1.4.1   Fuels that produce a flame, a stream of combustible
or flammable gases involved in the combustion reaction with a
gaseous oxidizer, radiate quantum emissions. These fuels
include flammable gases, flammable liquids, combustible
liquids, and solids that are burning with a flame.
B.5.1.4.2   Fuels that are oxidized in the solid phase or radia‐
tors that are emitting due to their internal temperature (sparks
and embers) radiate Planckian emissions. These fuels include
carbonaceous fuels such as coal, charcoal, wood, and cellulosic
fibers that are burning without an established flame, as well as
metals that have been heated due to mechanical impacts and
friction.
 
[B.5.1.3]
B.5.1.4.3   Almost all combustion events produce Planckian
emissions, emissions that are the result of the thermal energy
in the fuel mass. Therefore, spark/ember detectors that are
designed to detect these emissions are not fuel specific. Flame
detectors detect quantum emissions that are the result of
changes in molecular structure and energy state in the gas
phase. These emissions are uniquely associated with particular
molecular structures. This can result in a flame detector that is
very fuel specific.
B.5.1.5 Effects of Ambient.    The choice of radiant energy–
sensing detector is also limited by the effect of ambient condi‐
tions. The design must take into account the radiant energy
absorption of the atmosphere, presence of non-fire-related
radiation sources that might cause nuisance alarms, the electro‐
magnetic energy of the spark, ember, or fire to be detected, the
distance from the fire source to the sensor, and characteristics
of the sensor.
B.5.1.5.1 Ambient Non-Fire Radiators.   Most ambients contain
non-fire radiators that can emit at wavelengths used by radiant
energy–sensing detectors for fire detection. The designer
should make a thorough evaluation of the ambient to identify
radiators that have the potential for producing unwarranted
alarm response from radiant energy–sensing detectors. Since
radiant energy–sensing detectors use electronic components
that can act as antennas, the evaluation should include radio
band, microwave, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet sources.
B.5.1.5.2 Ambient Radiant Absorbance.    The medium through
which radiant energy passes from fire source to detector has a
finite transmittance. Transmittance is usually quantified by its
reciprocal, absorbance. Absorbance by atmospheric species
varies with wavelength. Gaseous species absorb at the same
wavelengths that they emit. Particulate species can transmit,
reflect, or absorb radiant emission, and the proportion that is
absorbed is expressed as the reciprocal of its emissivity, ℇ.
B.5.1.5.3 Contamination of Optical Surfaces.    Radiant energy
can be absorbed or reflected by materials contaminating the
optical surfaces of radiant energy–sensing detectors. The
designer should evaluate the potential for surface contamina‐
tion and implement provisions for keeping these surfaces
clean. Extreme caution must be employed when considering
the use of surrogate windows. Common glass, acrylic, and other
glazing materials are opaque at the wavelengths used by most

flame detectors and some spark/ember detectors. Placing a
window between the detector and the hazard area that has not
been listed by a nationally recognized testing laboratory
(NRTL) for use with the detector in question is a violation of
the detector listing and will usually result in a system that is
incapable of detecting a fire in the hazard area.
B.5.1.5.4 Design Factors.    These factors are important for
several reasons. First, a radiation sensor is primarily a line-of-
sight device, and must “see” the fire source. If there are other
radiation sources in the area, or if atmospheric conditions are
such that a large fraction of the radiation could be absorbed in
the atmosphere, the type, location, and spacing of the sensors
could be affected. In addition, the sensors react to specific
wavelengths, and the fuel must emit radiation in the sensor’s
bandwidth. For example, an infrared detection device with a
single sensor tuned to 4.3 microns (the CO 2 emission peak)
cannot be expected to detect a non-carbon-based fire. Further‐
more, the sensor needs to be able to respond reliably within
the required time, especially when activating an explosion
suppression system or similar fast-response extinguishing or
control system.
B.5.1.6 Detector Response Model.    The response of radiant
energy–sensing detectors is modeled with a modified inverse
square relationship as shown in the following equation [5]:
S kPe
d
d
=
− ζ
2
where:
S = radiant power reaching the detector (W or Btu/sec) suffi‐
cient to produce alarm response
k = proportionality constant for the detector
P = radiant power emitted by the fire (W or Btu/sec)
ζ = extinction coefficient of air at detector operating wave‐
lengths
d = distance between the fire and the detector (m or ft)
This relationship models the fire as a point source radiator,
of uniform radiant output per steradian, some distance ( d)
from the detector. This relationship also models the effect of
absorbance by the air between the fire and the detector as
being a uniform extinction function. The designer must verify
that these modeling assumptions are valid for the application
in question.
B.5.2 Design of Flame Detection Systems.
B.5.2.1 Detector Sensitivity.   Flame detector sensitivity is tradi‐
tionally quantified as the distance at which the unit can detect
a fire of given size. The fire most commonly used by the NRTLs
in North America is a 0.9 m 2 (1.0 ft 2) fire fueled with regular
grade, unleaded gasoline. Some special-purpose detectors are
evaluated using 150 mm (6 in.) diameter fires fueled with
isopropanol.
B.5.2.1.1   This means of sensitivity determination does not
take into account that flames can best be modeled as an opti‐
cally dense radiator in which radiant emissions radiated from
the far side of the flame toward the detector are re-absorbed by
the flame. Consequently, the radiated power from a flame is
not proportional to the area of the fire but to the flame silhou‐
ette, and hence to the height and width of the fire.
 
[B.5.1.6]
B.5.2.1.2   Because flame detectors detect the radiant emissions
produced during the formation of flame intermediates and
products, the radiant intensity produced by a flame at a given
wavelength is proportional to the relative concentration of the
specific intermediate or product in the flame and that portion
of the total heat release rate of the fire resulting from the
formation of that specific intermediate or product. This means
that the response of a detector can vary widely as different fuels
are used to produce a fire of the same surface area and flame
width.
B.5.2.1.3   Many flame detectors are designed to detect specific
products such as water (2.5 microns) and CO 2 (4.35 microns).
These detectors cannot be used for fires that do not produce
these products as a result of the combustion process.
B.5.2.1.4   Many flame detectors use time variance of the radi‐
ant emissions of a flame to distinguish between non-fire radia‐
tors and a flame. Where a deflagration hazard exists, the
designer must determine the sample time period for such
flame detectors and how such detectors will operate in the
event of a deflagration of fuel vapor or fuel gases.
B.5.2.2 Design Fire.    Using the process outlined in
Section B.2, determine the fire size (kW or Btu/sec) at which
detection must be achieved.
B.5.2.2.1   Compute the surface area the design fire is expected
to occupy from the correlations in Table B.2.3.2.6.2(a) or other
sources. Use the flame height correlation to determine the
height of the flame plume:
h kQf = ( )0 182
2 5
.
/
   (for SI units)
or
h kQf = ( ) ( )0 584
2 5
.
/
   for inch-pound units
where:
hf = flame height (m or ft)
Q = heat release rate (kW or Btu/sec)
k = wall effect factor. Where there are no nearby walls, use k =
1; where the fuel package is near a wall, use k = 2; where
the fuel package is in a corner, use k = 4
Determine the minimum anticipated flame area width ( wf).
Where flammable or combustible liquids are the fuel load and
are unconfined, model the fuel as a circular pool. Compute the
radiating area (Ar) using the following equation:
A h w
r
f f
= 1
2
where:
Ar = radiating area (m2 or ft2)
hf = flame height (m or ft)
wf = flame width (m or ft)

B.5.2.2.2   The radiant power output of the fire to the detector
can be approximated as being proportional to the radiating
area (Ar) of the flame:
P cA r=
where:
Ar = radiating area (m2 or ft2)
c = power per unit area proportionality constant
P = radiated power (W or Btu/sec)
B.5.2.3 Calculate Detector Sensitivity.    Using Equation
B.5.2.2.1a or B.5.2.2.1b compute the radiating area of the test
fire used by the NRTL in the listing process ( At). The radiant
power output of the test fire to the detector in the listing proc‐
ess is proportional to the radiating area ( At) of the listing test
flame.
Δ B.5.2.4 Calculate Detector Response to Design Fire.    Because
the sensitivity of a flame detector is fixed during the manufac‐
turing process, the following is the relationship that determines
the radiant power reaching the detector sufficient to produce
an alarm response:
S kcA e
d
t
d
=
− ζ
2
where:
S = radiant power reaching the detector (W or Btu/sec) suffi‐
cient to produce alarm response
k = proportionality constant for the detector
At = radiant area of the listing test fire (m2 or ft2)
ζ = extinction coefficient of air at detector operating wave‐
lengths
d = distance between the fire and the detector during the list‐
ing fire test (m or ft)
c = emitted power per unit flame radiating area correlation
Because the sensitivity of the detector is constant over the
range of ambients for which it is listed:
S kcA e
d
r
d
= ′
′− ζ
2
where:
S = radiant power reaching the detector (W or Btu/sec) suffi‐
cient to produce alarm response
k = proportionality constant for the detector
c = emitted power per unit flame radiating area correlation
Ar = radiant area of the design fire (m2 or ft2)
ζ = extinction coefficient of air at detector operating wave‐
lengths
d′ = distance between the design fire and the detector (m or
ft)
 
[B.5.2.2.2]
 
[B.5.2.4a]
 
[B.5.2.4b]
Therefore, use the following equation to determine the
following:

This relation is solved iteratively for d′, the distance at which
the detector can detect the design fire.
B.5.2.5 Correction for Angular Displacement.
B.5.2.5.1   Most flame detectors exhibit a loss of sensitivity as
the fire is displaced from the optical axis of the detector. This
correction to the detector sensitivity is shown as a polar graph
in Figure A.17.8.3.2.3.
B.5.2.5.2   When the correction for angular displacement is
expressed as a reduction of normalized detection distance, the
correction is made to detection distance (d′).
B.5.2.5.3   When the correction for angular displacement is
expressed as a normalized sensitivity (fire size increment), the
correction must be made to Ar, prior to calculating response
distance (d′).
B.5.2.6 Corrections for Fuel.    Most flame detectors exhibit
some level of fuel specificity. Some manufacturers provide “fuel
factors” that relate detector response performance to a fire of
one fuel to the response performance of a benchmark fuel.
Other manufacturers provide performance criteria for a list of
specific fuels. Unless the manufacturer’s published instruc‐
tions, bearing the listing mark, contain explicit instructions for
the application of the detector for fuels other than those used
in the listing process, the unit cannot be deemed listed for use
in hazard areas containing fuels different from those employed
in the listing process.
B.5.2.6.1   When the fuel factor correction is expressed as a
detection distance reduction, the correction should be applied
after the detection distance has been computed.
B.5.2.6.2   When the fuel factor correction is expressed as a
function of normalized fire size, the correction must be made
prior to calculating detection distance.
B.5.2.7 Atmospheric Extinction Factors.
B.5.2.7.1   Because the atmosphere is not infinitely transmittent
at any wavelength, all flame detectors are affected by atmos‐
pheric absorption to some degree. The effect of atmospheric
extinction on the performance of flame detectors is deter‐
mined to some degree by the wavelengths used for sensing and
the detector electronic architecture. Values for the atmos‐
pheric extinction coefficient (ζ) should be obtained from the
detector manufacturer's published instructions.

B.5.2.7.2   The numerical value of ζ can be determined experi‐
mentally for any flame detector. The detector must be tested
with two different sized test fires to determine the distance at
which each of the fires can be detected by the detector in ques‐
tion. The larger the difference between the sizes of the flaming
fires, the more precise the determination of ζ. Ideally, one test
fire would be approximately 4 times the heat release rate
(surface area) of the other. The data are then used in the rela‐
tion:

A = the radiating area of the test fire as determined per
B.5.2.2.1
This relation allows the designer to determine the value of ζ
for detectors that are already installed or for those that were
evaluated for listing before the inclusion of the requirement
for the publishing of ζ appeared in ANSI/FM-3260.
B.5.3 Design of Spark/Ember Detection Systems.
B.5.3.1 Design Fire.    Using the process outlined in
Section B.2, determine the fire size (kW or Btu/sec) at which
detection must be achieved.
B.5.3.1.1   The quantification of the fire is generally derived
from the energy investment per unit time sufficient to propa‐
gate combustion of the combustible particulate solids in the
fuel stream. Because energy per unit time is power, expressed
in watts, the fire size criterion is generally expressed in watts or
milliwatts.
B.5.3.1.2   The radiant emissions, integrated over all wave‐
lengths, from a non-ideal Planckian radiator is expressed with
the following form of the Stefan–Boltzmann equation:
P A T= ε σ 4
where:
P = radiant power (W or Btu/sec)
ℇ = emissivity, a material property expressed as a fraction
between 0 and 1.0
A = area of radiator (m2 or ft2)
σ = Stefan–Boltzmann constant 5.67E-8 W/m2K4
T = temperature (K or R)
B.5.3.1.3   This models the spark or ember as a point source
radiator.
B.5.3.2 Fire Environment.   Spark/ember detectors are usually
used on pneumatic conveyance system ducts to monitor
combustible particulate solids as they flow past the detector(s).
This environment puts large concentrations of combustible
particulate solids between the fire and the detector. A value for
ζ must be computed for the monitored environment. The
simplifying assumption that absorbance at visible levels is equal

to or greater than that at infrared wavelengths yields conserva‐
tive designs and is used.

the sensitivity of a spark/ember detector is fixed during the
manufacturing process,
S kPe

where:
S = radiant power reaching the detector (W or Btu/sec) suffi‐

P = radiant power emitted by test spark (W or Btu/sec)
ζ = extinction coefficient of air at detector operating wave‐
lengths
d = distance between the fire and the detector during the list‐
ing fire test (m2 or ft2)
Because the sensitivity of the detector is constant over the
range of ambients for which it is listed,

wavelengths
d′ = the distance between the design fire and the detector (m2

ity as the fire is displaced from the optical axis of the detector.

B.5.3.4.2   When the correction for angular displacement is
expressed as a reduction of normalized detection distance, the
correction is made to detection distance (d′).
B.5.3.4.3   When the correction for angular displacement is
expressed as a normalized sensitivity (fire size increment), the
correction must be made to P′ prior to calculating response
distance (d′).
B.5.3.5 Corrections for Fuel.    Because spark/ember detectors
respond to Planckian emission in the near infrared portion of
the spectrum, corrections for fuels are rarely necessary.
B.6 Computer Fire Models.    Several special application
computer models are available to assist in the design and analy‐
sis of both heat detectors (e.g., fixed-temperature, rate-of-rise,
sprinklers, fusible links) and smoke detectors. These computer
models typically run on personal computers and are available
from NIST website http://fire.nist.gov.
B.6.1 DETACT — T 2.   DETACT — T 2 (DETector ACTuation
— time squared) calculates the actuation time of heat detectors
(fixed-temperature and rate-of-rise) and sprinklers to user-
specified fires that grow with the square of time. DETACT — T2
assumes the detector is located in a large compartment with an
unconfined ceiling, where there is no accumulation of hot
gases at the ceiling. Thus, heating of the detector is only from
the flow of hot gases along the ceiling. Input data include H, τ0,
RTI, Ts, S, and α. The program calculates the heat release rate
at detector activation, as well as the time to activation.
B.6.2 DETACT — QS.   DETACT — QS (DETector ACTuation
— quasi-steady) calculates the actuation time of heat detectors
and sprinklers in response to fires that grow according to a
user-defined fire. DETACT — QS assumes the detector is loca‐
ted in a large compartment with unconfined ceilings, where
there is no accumulation of hot gases at the ceiling. Thus, heat‐
ing of the detector is only from the flow of hot gases along the
ceiling. Input data include H, τ0, RTI, Ts, the distance of the
detector from the fire’s axis, and heat release rates at user-
specified times. The program calculates the heat release rate at
detector activation, the time to activation, and the ceiling jet
temperature.
DETACT — QS can also be found in HAZARD I, FIRE‐
FORM, FPETOOL. A comprehensive evaluation of DETACT
QS can be found in the SFPE Engineering Guide: Evaluation of the
Computer Fire Model DETACT QS . This guide provides informa‐
tion on the theoretical basis, mathematical robustness, sensitiv‐
ity of output to input, and an evaluation of the predictive
ability of the model.
B.6.3 LAVENT.   LAVENT (Link Actuated VENT) calculates
the actuation time of sprinklers and fusible link-actuated ceil‐
ing vents in compartment fires with draft curtains. Inputs
include the ambient temperature, compartment size, thermo‐
physical properties of the ceiling, fire location, size and growth
rate, ceiling vent area and location, RTI, and temperature
rating of the fusible links. Outputs of the model include the
temperatures and release times of the links, the areas of the
vents that have opened, the radial temperature distribution at
the ceiling, and the temperature and height of the upper layer.
B.6.4   JET is a single-compartment, two-zone computer model.
It has been designed to calculate the centerline temperature of
the plume, the ceiling jet temperature, and the ceiling jet
velocity. JET can model ceiling-mounted fusible links, as well as
link-actuated ceiling vents. JET evolved from the model plat‐
form used for LAVENT and contains many of the same
features. Some of the major differences between them include
the ceiling jet temperature and velocity algorithms, the fusible
link algorithm, and the use of a variable radiative fraction. [57]

ANNEX C 72-355
Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material. 2019 Edition
Annex C   System Performance and Design Guide
This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document
but is included for informational purposes only.
C.1 Scope.    The requirements of the protected premises chap‐
ter (Chapter 23) provide for minimum levels of protection for
fire alarm systems to protect life and property, regardless of the
building characteristics, contents, or use. This System Perform‐
ance and Design Guide provides additional considerations for
users of the NFAC when planning, designing, and installing
protected premises fire alarm systems for buildings that might
be unusual in scale, mission, use, symbolism, or other critical or
high-profile characteristics.
This guidance suggests potential system characteristics to
enhanced system performance for protection of life, mission,
and property in high-profile and other critical buildings,
including signaling path integrity, redundancies, survivability,
backup fire control stations, nonerasable logs, multiple infor‐
mation stations, and the benefits of networked and peer-to-
peer configurations.
C.2 Building Scale.    The size of a building to be protected
influences fire alarm system operating characteristics, control
functions, circuit integrity, annunciation, and other factors for
protection of life, property, or the mission of the building.
C.2.1 Fire Service Response Location(s).
C.2.1.1 Location(s).    Determine the fire service response loca‐
tion(s) by inquiry to the responding fire department (and
building operating personnel, if appropriate).
C.2.1.2 Quantity.    The fire service might desire more than one
response location. Building operators might desire redundan‐
cies for security or operations under emergency conditions.
C.2.1.3 Functions.    The primary response location is the
normally expected location of the fire command center (FCC).
In general, the fire command center provides information and
control functions for the entire building. One or more redun‐
dant or abbreviated fire command centers might be desired for
security or operations under emergency conditions.
C.2.1.3.1 Information.    Nonprimary response locations might
be intended to provide annunciation equipment to provide
information for the entire building, or for a portion of the
building associated with the response location.
C.2.1.3.2 Control.    Nonprimary response locations might be
intended to provide a partial or complete fire command center
to provide control functions for the entire building, or for a
portion of the building associated with the response location.
C.2.2 System Operational Characteristics.
C.2.2.1 On-Premises Response.    Determine an emergency
response plan considering the requirements of NFAC, local
codes and regulations, the availability and responsibility of
building operating personnel, and the mobility of occupants.
C.2.2.1.1 Investigation.    Building security or operating person‐
nel should investigate every alarm signal, and the emergency
response plan might include investigation of initial alarm
signals prior to activating a general alarm or the evacuation or
relocation of occupants.
C.2.2.1.2 Communication.    Determine appropriate methods
to provide alarm information, and instructions when required,
to building security and operating personnel, supervisory and
management personnel, and building occupants. Consider the
need for predetermined messages, single- or multiple-channel
communications systems, and coordination of communications
system coverage and zoning with building subdivisions, includ‐
ing smoke compartments and automatic suppression system
coverage and zoning. Consider the need for multiple languages
in emergency communications.
C.2.2.1.3 Evacuation/Relocation.    Determine the extent to
which the emergency egress plan is based on total evacuation,
relocation and partial evacuation, areas of rescue assistance
and/or defending in place.
C.2.2.1.4 Survivability.    Consider means to harden the fire
notification circuits/paths to attack by fire for a period of time
necessary to notify building operating personnel and occupants
of a fire emergency and/or provide instructions if appropriate.
C.2.2.1.5 Control.    Fire alarm system control units can be
arranged to actuate other building systems and to condition
passive fire barriers to enhance fire safety in the building.
C.2.2.1.6 Building Systems.    Consider activation or release of
building systems and elements including, but not limited to,
closing fire/smoke doors and dampers, recall of elevators,
unlocking stairway doors, activating smoke control systems and
or shut-down fans to prevent recirculation of smoke.
C.2.2.1.7 Fire Scene Operations.    Compartmentation, water
supply, fire fighter access, and communication links are impor‐
tant for manual fire-fighting operations. Fire alarm system
monitoring, reporting, display, and control functions that
enhance the maintenance and operation of these elements that
enhance fire scene operations should be considered in the
design, installation, and maintenance of protected premises
fire alarm systems. An example would be a flashing visual notifi‐
cation appliance over the fire department connection.
C.2.2.2 External Response.
C.2.2.2.1 Resources Available.   Determine the availability and
responsibility of fire service resources. An example of the use
of this information might be determining how to stage evacua‐
tion.
C.2.2.2.2 Time Required.   Consider the time required for fire
service response to the building. Consider travel time at various
times of day and seasons of year.
C.2.2.2.3 Notification.   Determine one or more acceptable
means of automatic and manual notification of the fire service
to initiate response to the building. Consider the extent of
information that might be transmitted to the responding fire
service to enhance response to the building and to provide
incident information prior to its arrival.
C.2.2.2.4 Evacuation/Relocation.    Consider system opera‐
tional characteristics that might enhance coordination of
control and direction to building operating personnel and
occupants. Consider means of control and shift in control of
evacuation or relocation direction from building operating
personnel to fire service command.
C.2.2.2.5 Knowledge of Premises.    Harmonize system operat‐
ing characteristics to pre-incident planning with fire service
and building operating and security personnel.

2019 Edition Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material.
C.2.2.2.6 Communications and Control.    Provide for fire-
fighter communications through dedicated two-way fire-fighter
communication systems, or consider a means to provide
enhanced operation of fire service radio communications in
the protected premises.
C.3 Premises Mission/Use/Property Protection.    The loss of
use or mission of a facility to the effects of accidental fire can
have a very significant impact on the community or organiza‐
tion served by the facility. In such a case, it is appropriate to
enhance functional characteristics of the protected premises
system. Considerations include the following:
(1) Criticality/Mission Continuity
(a) Community — Loss of operations of the facility
might affect the community beyond the facility.
Consider the sensitivity of fire detection and the
effectiveness of alarm processing, emergency
response, and fire suppression to minimize effects
on the community served due to facility impairment
by fire.
(b) Operations
1. On-premises — Fire might result in business
interruption or reduced effectiveness.
2. Elsewhere — Services provided by the facility
to remote locations might cease or be
reduced.
(2) Life Safety
(a) Evacuation/Relocation — Size, distribution, and
mobility of the occupant population should be
considered with knowledge of facility emergency
planning and availability of emergency response
resources to determine the extent to which people
movement might be managed during a fire inci‐
dent.
(b) Defend-In-Place — A protected premises system
might be used to actuate facility fire safety elements
necessary to defend occupants in place or to
enhance rescue assistance.
(3) Property
(a) Value — Cost, availability, and time required to rees‐
tablish facility contents should be considered when
determining the sensitivity of fire detection and the
effectiveness of alarm processing, emergency
response, and fire suppression.
(b) Replacement — Availability and time required to
replace damaged facility contents should be consid‐
ered when determining the sensitivity of fire detec‐
tion and the effectiveness of alarm processing
emergency response and fire suppression.
(c) Redundancy — Duplication of facility contents in
separate locations might reduce the need for sensi‐
tivity of fire detection or other property protection
system capabilities.
C.4 Protected Premises Signaling System Features.
C.4.1 Event Logs.    Computer processor–based systems are
capable of assembling logs of system events by date and time,
including alarm history. Such logs are an important resource in
assessing system performance or malfunctions and in under‐
standing or reconstructing a fire event after the fact. It is
imperative that such logs are preserved and protected against
deletion until it is affirmed that no further need for a log
exists. Caution is recommended to secure system history logs
when system software changes are made.
C.4.2 Network Configuration.   Systems that use digital means
to transfer signal information might provide benefits in econ‐
omy of installation and distribution of information to multiple
locations to enable rigorous alarm processing and response.
Transmission of digital alarm information to remote locations
might assist responding personnel by providing incident infor‐
mation prior to arrival at the location of the fire.
C.4.3 Peer to Peer Data Communication.    Systems that dupli‐
cate the operating and history data bases in multiple network
control units provide redundant monitoring and control points
on a system that can enhance the reliability of the system and
the operation of the system during emergency or degraded
conditions.
Annex D   Speech Intelligibility
This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document
but is included for informational purposes only.
Users of Annex D should refer back to the text of NFPA 72
to familiarize themselves with the specific requirements for the
planning, design, installation, and testing of voice communica‐
tion systems.
D.1 Introduction.
D.1.1   This annex is intended to provide guidance on the plan‐
ning, design, installation, and testing of voice communication
systems. The majority of this annex contains recommendations
for testing of the intelligibility of voice systems.
D.1.2   As with most systems, proper system performance is
related to good planning, design, installation, and mainte‐
nance. Similarly, test results are a valuable feedback mechanism
for persons planning, designing, and installing systems.
D.1.3   This annex describes when, where, and how to test for
speech intelligibility. It is also not the intent of this test proto‐
col to describe how to interpret results or how to correct
systems or environments that contribute to poor speech intelli‐
gibility.
D.1.4   For occupancies that do not yet exist, the designer
should have an understanding of the acoustic characteristics of
the architectural design, as well as the acoustic performance
properties of available loudspeakers. Architecturally, this
includes the physical size and shape of the space, as well as the
acoustic properties of the walls, floors, ceilings, and interior
furnishings. A proper design analysis can sometimes reveal that
an intelligible system is not achievable unless some features of
the architectural design are changed. The designer should be
prepared to defend such conclusions and, if necessary, refuse
to certify the installation of such a system. While “hand calcula‐
tions” and experience work well for simpler installations, more
complex designs are frequently better and more cost-effectively
analyzed using one of a number of readily available computer-
based design programs.
D.1.5   The designer and the authority having jurisdiction
should both be aware that the acoustic performance parame‐
ters of the chosen loudspeakers, as well as their placement in
the structure, play a major role in determining how many appli‐
ances are necessary for adequate intelligibility. The numerical
count of appliances for a given design and protected space

cannot, by itself, be used to determine the adequacy of the
design. Sometimes, the acoustic problems of certain placement
constraints can be satisfactorily overcome through the careful
selection of loudspeakers with the requisite performance char‐
acteristics, rather than by increasing their number.
D.2 Fundamentals of Test Protocol.
D.2.1 Measurement Method.
D.2.1.1 STI/STIPA.
D.2.1.1.1   Where the method for measuring speech intelligibil‐
ity is the Speech Transmission Index (STI), this test protocol
should be followed.
D.2.1.1.2   There are several methods that measure the STI.
One method common to the emergency communications
system industry uses a test signal referred to as STIPA — STI-
Public Address.
D.2.1.2 Other Methods.    Where the method for measuring
speech intelligibility is the Phonetically Balanced Word test
(PB), Modified Rhyme Test (MRT), or Speech Intelligibility
Index (SII) method, the same methods for determining meas‐
urement locations should be used.

D.2.3 Terminology.
D.2.3.1 Acoustically Distinguishable Space (ADS).
D.2.3.1.1   An acoustically distinguishable space (ADS) can be
an emergency communication system notification zone, or
subdivision thereof, that can be an enclosed or otherwise physi‐
cally defined space, or that can be distinguished from other
spaces because of different acoustical, environmental, or use
characteristics such as reverberation time and ambient sound
pressure level. The ADS might have acoustical design features
that are conducive for voice intelligibility, or it might be a space
where voice intelligibility could be difficult or impossible to
achieve.
D.2.3.1.2   All parts of a building or area intended to have occu‐
pant notification are subdivided into ADSs as defined. Some
ADSs might be designated to have voice communications capa‐
bility and require that those communications be intelligible.
Other spaces might not require voice intelligibility or might
not be capable of reliable voice intelligibility. Each is still refer‐
red to as an ADS.
D.2.3.1.3   In smaller areas, such as those under 400 ft2 (40 m2),
walls alone will define the ADS. In larger areas, other factors
might have to be considered. In spaces that might be subdivi‐
ded by temporary or movable partitions, such as ballrooms and
meeting rooms, each individual configuration should be
considered a separate ADS. Physical characteristics such as a
change in ceiling height of more than 20 percent or change in
acoustical finish, such as carpet in one area and tile in another,
would require those areas to be treated as separate ADSs. In
larger areas there might be noise sources that require a section
to be treated as a separate ADS. Any significant change in ambi‐
ent sound pressure level or frequency might necessitate an area
be considered a separate ADS.
D.2.3.1.4   In areas of 85 dBA or greater ambient sound pres‐
sure level, meeting the pass/fail criteria for intelligibility might
not be possible and other means of communication might be
necessary. So, for example, the space immediately surrounding
a printing press or other high noise machine might be designa‐
ted as a separate ADS and the design might call for some form
of effective notification but not necessarily require the ability to
have intelligible voice communication. The aisles or operator’s
control stations might be separate ADSs where intelligible voice
communication might be desired.
D.2.3.1.5   Significant differences in furnishings, for example,
an area with tables, desks, or low dividers adjacent to an area
with high shelving, would require separate consideration. The
entire desk area could be a single acoustic zone whereas each
area between shelving could be a unique zone. Essentially, any
noteworthy change in the acoustical environment within an
area will mandate consideration of that portion of the area to
be treated as an acoustic zone. Hallways and stairwells will typi‐
cally be considered as individual acoustic zones.
D.2.3.1.6   Spaces confined by walls with carpeting and acousti‐
cal ceilings can be deemed to be one ADS. An ADS should be
an area of consistent size and material. A change of materials
from carpet to hard tile, the existence of sound sources such as
decorative waterfalls, large expanses of glass, and changes in
ceiling height are all factors that might separate one ADS from
another.
D.2.3.1.7   Each ADS might require different components and
design features to achieve intelligible voice communication.
For example, two ADSs with similar acoustical treatments and
noise levels might have different ceiling heights. The ADS with
the lower ceiling height might require more ceiling-mounted
loudspeakers to ensure that all listeners are in a direct sound
field. See Figure D.2.3.1.7. Other ADSs might benefit from the
use of alternate loudspeaker technologies such as line arrays to
achieve intelligibility.
D.2.3.1.8   An ADS that differs from another because of the
frequency and level of ambient sound pressure level might
require the use of loudspeakers and system components that
have a wider frequency bandwidth than conventional emer‐
gency communications equipment. However, designers should
not use higher bandwidth loudspeakers in all locations unless
needed to overcome certain acoustic and ambient conditions.
This is because the higher bandwidth appliance will require
more energy to perform properly. This increases amplifier and
wire size and power supply requirements.
D.2.3.1.9   In some spaces it might be impractical to achieve
intelligibility, and in such a case alternatives to voice evacuation
might be required within such areas.
D.2.3.1.10   There might be some areas of a facility where there
are several spaces of the same approximate size and with the
same acoustic properties. For example, there might be an
office space with multiple individual offices, each with one

loudspeaker. If one or two are satisfactorily tested, there is no
need to test all of them for speech intelligibility.
D.2.3.2 Audibility Test.   Measurement of the sound pressure
level of a tone signal in accordance with the requirements of
NFPA 72.
D.2.3.3 Intelligibility Test.   A test method used to predict how
well speech is understood by a listener.
D.2.3.4 Occupied Ambient Sound Pressure Level.   The period
of time when the building involved in the test is occupied and
is reasonably close to having maximum background noise. For
example, this might involve the operation of HVAC equipment,
an industrial process, or a maximum number of occupants
such as might occur in a place of public assembly.
D.2.3.5 STI or STIPA Test Signal.
D.2.3.5.1   A special audio signal that is played over the emer‐
gency communications system being tested.
D.2.3.5.2   Instruments that measure STI using a STIPA signal
use a special signal that consists of signals in seven octave
bands. The sound in each octave band is modulated using two
(separate) modulation frequencies. The STI and STIPA have
been standardized in IEC 60268. However, at the present time,
the implementation of the measurement software and correla‐
tions with the test signal can differ between instrument manu‐
facturers. Therefore, until there is further standardization, only
the test signal recommended by the instrument manufacturer
should be used with their instrument. Although the STIPA test
signals can sound similar, there might be speed or other differ‐
ences that affect results if one manufacturer's test signal is used
with another manufacturer’s instrument.
D.2.3.6 Talkbox.    An instrument usually consisting of a high
quality audio loudspeaker and a CD player or other method
used to play an STI or STIPA test signal.
D.2.3.7 Unoccupied Ambient Sound Pressure Level.    The
period of time when the primary occupants of the facility are
not present, or when ambient sound pressure level is not at its
highest level.
D.2.4 Acceptability Criteria.
D.2.4.1   The intelligibility of an emergency communication
system is considered acceptable if at least 90 percent of the
measurement locations within each ADS have a measured STI
of not less than 0.45 (0.65 CIS) and an average STI of not less
than 0.50 STI (0.70 CIS).
D.2.4.2   Speech intelligibility is not a physical quantity like
meters, feet, amperes, volts, or even decibels. It is a benchmark
of the degree to which we understand spoken language, and as
such is a complex phenomenon affected by many variables
(Ref: Jacob, K. & Tyson, T., “Computer-Based Prediction of
Speech Intelligibility for Mass Notification Systems,” SUPDET
2008, Fire Protection Research Foundation, Mar 2008). There
are two basic categories of intelligibility testing: (1) subject
(human) based testing and (2) instrument based test methods.
Test methods that use human subjects are only statistical
predictions of how well speech might be understood at any
other time for any other group of listeners. Several subject
based test methods have been extensively researched, tested for
reliability, and standardized. Examples include the Phonetically
Balanced (PB) word scores (256 words or 1000 words) and
Modified Rhyme Test (MRT). (Ref: ANSI S3.2-1989 revised
2009, “Method for Measuring the Intelligibility of Speech over
Communication Systems.” Ref: ISO/TR 4870, “Acoustics —
The Construction and Calibration of Speech Intelligibility
Tests”).
D.2.4.3   Subject based test methods can gauge how much of
the spoken information is correctly understood by a person or
group of persons for that particular test. When properly done,
that resulting value is a prediction of how much of the spoken
word will be correctly understood by others at some other time.
Therefore, the results of speech intelligibility testing are usually
described as predictions, not measurements. However, most
users of the instruments refer to the results as measurements,
not as predictions. Since the use of portable instruments is the
more common method in the alarm and emergency communi‐
cations industries, in this document the results will be referred
to as measurements to avoid confusion. However, in scientific
and general acoustic literature, readers can see the measured
values correctly referred to as predictions.
D.2.4.4   Several instrument based methods for predicting
speech intelligibility have been extensively researched and
tested for accuracy and repeatability, and the methods have
been standardized, most notably the Speech Intelligibility
Index (SII) (formerly the Articulation Index, AI), Speech
Transmission Index (STI), and Speech Transmission Index for
Public Address (STIPA) (Ref: IEC 60268-16, “Sound system
equipment — Part 16: Objective rating of speech intelligibility
by speech transmission index”, 2003. Ref: ANSI/ASA S3.5,
“American National Standard Methods for Calculation of the
Speech Intelligibility Index”, 1997). Accuracy is how close the
meter corresponds to actual human test results. Thus, even
71.5 ft (21.8 m) 
117 ft (35.7 m) 
45.5 ft (13.9 m) 
8.5 ft (2.6 m)

though an instrument is used, the results are subjective in that
they correlate with how humans perceive the quality of speech.
D.2.4.5   Each of the established methods for measuring speech
intelligibility has its own scale. The Common Intelligibility
Scale (CIS) was developed in 1995 to show the relationship
between the different methods and to permit codes and stand‐
ards to require a certain level of performance while permitting
any of the accepted measurement methods to be employed
(Ref: Barnett, P.W. and Knight, A.D., “The Common Intelligi‐
bility Scale,” Proceedings of the Institute of Acoustics, Vol. 17,
Part 7, 1995). The Speech Transmission Index (STI) is widely
used and has been implemented in portable equipment using a
modified method called STIPA (STI Public Address). For this
reason, the performance metrics cited in this document use
units of STI with units of CIS in parentheses. The relationship
between the two is: CIS = 1+log (STI). Relationships between
other methods can be found in the literature (Ref: IEC 60849,
Annex B, Sound Systems for Emergency Purposes, Feb 1998).
D.2.4.6   If an ADS is small enough to only require one meas‐
urement location (see D.3.7 for the recommendation for meas‐
urement point spacing), the result should be 0.50 STI
(0.70 CIS) or more for the ADS to pass the requirement for
speech intelligibility. This is based on the requirement for an
average of 0.50 STI (0.70 CIS) or more in that ADS. Therefore,
a single measurement of 0.45 STI (0.65 CIS) would not be
considered acceptable, because that one measurement would
be below the minimum required average of 0.50 STI (0.70 CIS)
in that ADS.
D.2.4.7   If the value at that one measurement location were
less than 0.50 STI (0.70 CIS), additional measurements could
be taken at that same single measurement location. As with
simple sound pressure level measurements, intelligibility meas‐
urements at any point will vary. If the average of all the meas‐
urements at that location were 0.50 STI (0.70 CIS) or more, the
ADS would pass the requirement for speech intelligibility.
Δ D.2.4.8   Some ADSs might require multiple measurement
points due to their larger size. (See D.3.7 for the recommenda‐
tion for measurement point spacing.) However, even in a small
ADS where one measurement point would be permitted, a
designer might intend that multiple measurements be made
because of conditions that might result in specific points
having intelligibility scores below the minimum. Where an ADS
has multiple measurement locations, the requirement is that at
least 90 percent of the measurement locations have values not
less than 0.45 STI (0.65 CIS) and that all measurement points
average to 0.50 STI (0.70 CIS) or greater.
D.2.4.9   The use of an average intelligibility score as a part of
the requirement permits a wider range of measured values
within an ADS than would a simple minimum requirement. A
range of permitted values is not appropriate since there is no
need for an upper limit for intelligibility — prefect intelligibil‐
ity is certainly acceptable.
Δ D.2.4.10   The requirement that only 90 percent of the meas‐
ured points in the ADS meet the minimum and that the aver‐
age for the entire ADS be 0.50 STI (0.70 CIS) or greater
recognizes that in any space, with any system and any set of
acoustic conditions, there can be points where the intelligibility
score might be below the minimum. See also the discussion in
D.2.3.1 on the definition of an ADS and how some ADSs might
be designated to not require speech intelligibility at all. For
example, in a room that is otherwise similar from an acoustics
standpoint, the space around a loud machine might be one
ADS while the rest of the room is a separate ADS. The ADS
surrounding the machine might be designed to have some
form of occupant notification but not to have intelligible voice
communications. This type of ADS designation permits the
remainder of the room to be scored without being penalized by
the fact that intelligible communication near some loud sound
sources might not be possible.
D.2.4.11   The intelligibility performance requirement cited
herein intentionally uses two decimal points. Portable instru‐
ments that use the STIPA method for measuring the Speech
Transmission Index (STI) generally have a precision on the
order of 0.02 to 0.03 (Ref: Sander J. van Wijngaarden and Jan
A. Verhave, Past Present and Future of the Speech Transmis‐
sion Index, Chapter 9, Measurement and Prediction of Speech
Intelligibility in Traffic Tunnels Using the STI, p113, TNO
Human Factors, The Netherlands, 2002). Other methods that
measure STI can have a greater measurement precision. Other
measurement methods, such as Modified Rhyme Test (MRT),
Phonetically Balanced Word (PB) lists, and Speech Intelligibil‐
ity Index (SII), also have levels of precision in the hundredths
when properly conducted and scored. However, there might be
slight variations in measured values between any two meters or
between any two persons taking measurements with the same
instrument, or between any two listener panels when using
subject based test methods. This is true for any measurement
method or instrument, including simple scales for measuring
length or mass.
D.2.4.12   Measurements should be made and recorded using
two decimal places. Averages can be calculated to three deci‐
mal points and rounded. The calculated average value should
be rounded to the nearest five-hundredths (0.05) to reflect
possible measurement errors and the intent of the requirement
(Ref: Mapp, P., “Systematic & Common Errors in Sound System
STI and Intelligibility Measurements,” Convention Paper 6271,
Audio Engineering Society, 117th Convention, San Fran, CA,
28–31 Oct 2004. Ref: Peter Mapp, Past Present and Future of
the Speech Transmission Index, Chapter 8, Practical Applica‐
tion of STI to Assessing Public Address and Emergency Sound
Systems, TNO Human Factors, The Netherlands, 2002). For
example, averages of 0.47–0.525 STI would all be rounded to
report an average of 0.50 STI (0.70 CIS). The minimum value
permitted for all but 10 percent of the measurement locations
in an ADS should be 0.45 STI (0.65 CIS) or greater. For exam‐
ple, values of 0.44 STI are below the minimum; they are not
rounded up to 0.45 STI.
D.2.5 Limitations of Test Method.
D.2.5.1   Equipment designed in accordance with UL 864 and
fire alarm loudspeakers designed in accordance with UL 1480
are only tested for and only required to produce frequencies of
400 to 4000 Hz. Speech, however, includes a wider range of
frequencies. Speech intelligibility measurements using STI and
STIPA include octave band measurements that range from
125 Hz to 8000 Hz. STI results are most dependent on the
2000, 1000, 500, and 4000 Hz octave bands (in order of weight‐
ing) and to a lesser extent the 8000 and 250 Hz octave bands
and to an even lesser extent, the 125 Hz band (again, in order
of weighting).
D.2.5.2   While the lower and higher octave bands in STI calcu‐
lations are weighted much less than the others, under certain
acoustic conditions, systems that do not produce the highs and
the lows can produce speech intelligibility that is less than

desired. This does not imply that all systems should use equip‐
ment capable of greater bandwidth sound reproduction. While
the larger frequency response will probably sound better and
be more intelligible to a listener, it might not be necessary for
the minimum desired performance. The use of equipment
with higher bandwidth will require an increase in power
supplies, amplifiers, and wire sizes to drive the loudspeaker
appliances.
D.2.5.3   Areas of high ambient sound pressure levels (“noise”)
might be incapable of meeting the acceptability criteria in
D.2.4.
Δ D.2.5.4   In areas where the ambient sound pressure level
exceeds 90 dBA, satisfactory speech intelligibility is difficult to
achieve with conventional communications equipment and
design practice. A better system design might include alternate
communications methods, such as signs and displays, or might
involve providing occupant notification but not voice alarm
communication at that location.
D.2.5.5   Impulse sounds made during measurements can
impact measurement accuracy or cause instrument error.
D.2.5.6   Impulse sounds such as accidentally tapping the meter
microphone, or a nearby door slamming can cause a measure‐
ment error. Some meters will display an error message. If an
impulse sound occurs during the measurement, consider
taking another measurement to check the results. This process
is analogous to ignoring temporary sound sources, as permitted
by NFPA 72 when taking sound pressure level measurements.
D.2.5.7   Natural variation in ambient sound pressure level
levels can affect the results.
D.2.6 General Requirements.
D.2.6.1   The qualified staff should be identified on the system
design documents. Acceptable evidence of qualifications or
certification should be provided when requested by the author‐
ity having jurisdiction. Qualified personnel should include, but
not be limited to, one or more of the following:
(1) Personnel who are factory trained and certified for fire
alarm system design of the specific type and brand of
system addressed by this test protocol
(2) Personnel who are certified by a nationally recognized
certification organization acceptable to the authority
having jurisdiction
(3) Personnel who are registered, licensed, or certified by a
state or local authority
D.2.6.2   All necessary precautions should be taken with the
facility owner to work with appropriately qualified staff when
handling or performing any function with the emergency
communications system control unit.
D.2.6.3   Testing impairment and record keeping requirements
of NFPA 72, Chapter 14 should apply.
D.2.6.4   Test measurements and other documentation should
be maintained as required by the authority having jurisdiction.
D.2.6.5   Impairment management procedures of NFPA 72 ,
Section 10.21 should be followed.
Δ D.2.6.6 Test Participants.    The test participants should include
representatives of the following: building owners , the organiza‐
tions responsible for the fire alarm or emergency communica‐
tions system design and installation, system equipment supplier
and/or manufacturer, and the authority having jurisdiction.
D.3 Pre-Planning.
D.3.1 Facility Occupancy and Use.
D.3.1.1 Occupancy/Use Types.    Prior to testing, the pre-
planning effort should identify the occupancy or use type to
better minimize disruption to the facility occupants during the
test.
D.3.1.2 Normal Operational Time Periods.    Prior to testing,
pre-planning efforts should identify the operational time peri‐
ods when the occupied ambient sound pressure level and the
unoccupied ambient sound pressure level are most likely to
occur.
D.3.1.3 Testing Before Building Furnishing Completion.    It
might be necessary to perform testing to permit partial use
before the building is in its final acoustic configuration. The
results of intelligibility testing at this stage can differ from the
final performance of the system. It might be necessary to work
with the authority having jurisdiction to develop a testing plan.
For example, until acoustical treatments such as carpeting, ceil‐
ing tiles, and other furnishings are in place, the system can be
partially tested to meet audibility requirements but not necessa‐
rily intelligibility requirements. Other test plans or mitigating
procedures might be permitted.
D.3.1.4 Facility Construction and Condition.    Construction in
the facility to be tested should be completed for areas that will
be subject to intelligibility testing. This specifically requires that
the command center and all locations of system microphones
to be tested should be completed. Any location of remote
system microphones not tested during this time should be
noted, and said locations should be fully tested with positive
results within 90 days of area occupancy or as required by the
authority having jurisdiction. Also, all building systems such as
environmental conditioning systems should be completed and
operational, as they both produce noise and provide acoustic
noise travel paths. In addition, all floor treatments and any
acoustical wall or ceiling treatments should be in place.
D.3.1.5 System Under Test Status.    The system under test
should be completed for all areas where intelligibility testing
will be done.
D.3.1.6 System Under Test Power.    System under test should
be on permanent primary power source as defined in NFPA 72.
D.3.1.7 System Under Test Secondary Power.    Secondary
power, where required and/or provided for the system under
test, should be fully functional. If batteries are used for this
purpose, batteries should be fully charged for a minimum of
48 hours prior to the commencement of any testing.
D.3.2 Emergency Communications Equipment.
D.3.2.1   As discussed in D.2.3.1, not all ADSs will require or be
capable of intelligible voice communications. It is the design‐
er’s job to define areas that will have voice communication
versus those that might have tone-only signaling, as well as
which spaces will have visual notification appliances (strobes) ,
textual signage, or other forms of notification and/or commu‐
nication. This document intends that “notification” mean any
form of notification, not just voice communication, whether
audible, visual, or using some other human sense.

D.3.2.2   There might be applications where not all spaces will
require intelligible voice signaling (Ref: NFPA 72, 2007,
Section A.7.4.1.4). For example, in a residential occupancy
such as an apartment, the authority having jurisdiction and the
designer might agree to a system that achieves the required
audibility throughout but does not result in intelligible voice
signaling in the bedrooms. The system would be sufficient to
awaken and alert. However, intelligibility might not be achieved
in the bedrooms with the doors closed and the sounder in the
adjacent hallway or room. In some cases this can require that
messages repeat a sufficient number of times to ensure that
occupants can reach a location where the system is sufficiently
intelligible to be understood. Systems that use tone signaling in
some areas and voice signaling in other areas would not
require voice intelligibility in those areas only covered by the
tone.
D.3.2.3 Emergency Communications System Control Unit.
The system under test for the emergency communications
system should be located and identified prior to testing, and its
operation features necessary for the testing clarified. Personnel
who are authorized to access and service the control unit are
necessary for the testing and should be included within the
team performing the tests. If necessary, notification to locations
beyond the facility that is being tested (e.g., fire department or
a supervising station) should be notified of the tests, and if
appropriate, their automatic notification feature disabled.
Upon completion of the tests the emergency communications
system should be returned to its normal operating condition.
D.3.2.4 Test Set-up.   The function and operation of the emer‐
gency communication system control unit should be reviewed
with personnel authorized to access and operate this equip‐
ment. Information should be acquired on the functioning of
the voice notification portion of the system, and whether it has
zone capabilities that will allow minimal disruption to building
occupants by testing each zone individually. The test plan
should also specify whether other functions of the system, such
as elevator recall and air handler control, will be disabled
during the testing of the emergency communications system.
D.3.2.5 System Under Test Calibration.    The complete system
under test audio path should be fully calibrated in accordance
with manufacturer’s published instructions. On systems with
adjustable technology, if manufacturer’s published instructions
are not provided, the alternate calibration procedure offered
below can be employed to calibrate the system under test.
D.3.2.5.1 Alternate Calibration Procedure.
D.3.2.5.1.1   This calibration is to be performed with the system
under test on normal AC power, then checked with the system
on secondary power (if so equipped).
D.3.2.5.1.2   The system under test amplifier output or the
circuit being calibrated should have a minimum of a 1-watt
load during the calibration process.
D.3.2.5.1.3   Perform pre-test occupant and remote monitoring
station notification requirements specified in NFPA 72, Chap‐
ter 14.
D.3.2.5.1.4   Introduce a 1 kHz sine-wave tone (± 100 Hz) at
90 dBA-fast 4” (4 in.) to the system microphone on-axis,
perpendicular to the face of the microphone.
D.3.2.5.1.5   Place the system under test into manual paging
mode (microphone “live” and connected to amplifier circuitry
with notification appliance circuits active).
D.3.2.5.1.6   Using a 4-digit accuracy RMS meter, set on AC
scale, set the output of the System Under Test audio notifica‐
tion appliance circuits to between 24 and 26 Vrms for 25.2 volt
systems or between 69 and 71 Vrms for 70.7 volt systems.
D.3.2.5.1.7   Once system under test manual paging mode has
been calibrated, prerecorded tone (if so equipped) should
then be tested by playing it through the system under test to
ensure that there is no more than a 3 dBA difference between
manual paging using the system microphone and the prerecor‐
ded message. The dBA measurement should be made using an
integrating/averaging meter and averaged over approximately
10 seconds of voice announcement to compensate for voice
amplitude modulation.
D.3.2.5.1.8   On a system under test with more than one emer‐
gency paging microphone and/or prerecorded message units,
the primary units should be calibrated, then secondary units
tested to ensure that they produce signals throughout the
system under test at the same amplitude as the primary units.
D.3.3 Plans and Specifications.
D.3.3.1   The approved plans and specifications for the system
should be used to plan and document the tests.
D.3.3.2   Testing is best accomplished using large scale plans
showing all notification appliances.
D.3.3.3   The plans should show the different system notifica‐
tion zones.
D.3.3.4   The type and location of the notification appliances
used in the emergency communication system should be iden‐
tified prior to testing.
D.3.3.5   Notification appliance symbols should differentiate
the type of appliance where more than one type is used.
D.3.3.6   Notification appliance symbols should include the
design wattage for each loudspeaker appliance.
D.3.3.7   The plans should show the ambient sound pressure
levels used as a basis for the system design.
D.3.4 Calculating Percentage of Articulation Loss of Conso‐
nants (% ALCONS).   There are occasions in which a space may
not be available to take test measurements in prior to the
design being completed. One method of calculation for the
Speech Intelligibly Index is by calculating percentage of articu‐
lation loss of consonants (%ALCONS). The formula is:
% ( ) /AL D RT N VQMCONS = 656 2 60
2 2
where:
D2 = distance from the loudspeaker to the farthest listener
RT60 = reverberation time (seconds)
N = power ratio of LW causing LD to the LW of all devices
except those causing LD
V = volume of the room (ft3)
Q = directivity index (ratio)
M = DC modifier (usually 1)

D.3.5 Assignment of Acoustically Distinguishable Spaces.
D.3.5.1   ADSs should be assigned prior to the test, and be
subject to review by all test participants.
D.3.5.2   ADS assignments should be a part of the original
design process. See the discussion in D.2.3.1.
D.3.5.3   The design drawings should be used to plan and show
the limits of each ADS where there is more than one.
D.3.5.4   All areas that are intended to have audible occupant
notification, whether by tone only or by voice are to be designa‐
ted as one or more ADSs. See D.2.3.1.
D.3.5.5   The drawings or a table listing all ADSs should be
used to indicate which ADSs will require intelligible voice
communications and which will not. The same drawings or
table could be used to list audibility requirements where tones
are used and to list any forms of visual or other notification or
communications methods being employed in the ADS.
D.3.5.6   ADS layouts that differ from the original, approved
design documents should be approved by the authority having
jurisdiction.
D.3.6 Spaces Not Requiring Testing.
D.3.6.1   Buildings and areas of buildings that are not acousti‐
cally challenging such as traditional office environments, hotel
guest rooms, dwelling units, and spaces with carpeting and
furnishings generally meet intelligibility levels if the audibility
levels are consistent with the requirements of NFPA 72 .
Performing intelligibility testing might not be necessary in
these areas. Areas of a typical building that can be acoustically
challenging could include vehicle parking levels and large
lobby areas with hard floors and wall surfaces, stairs, and other
spaces with high reverberation. Intelligibility meeting the
requirements in this document can be difficult to achieve
throughout these spaces. Specialized sound system design
procedures, principles, and equipment might be necessary to
achieve speech intelligibility in high noise areas or areas with
challenging acoustics. Alternatively, intelligibility could be
provided near exits and within specific areas (elevator lobby of
a parking level) where occupants can obtain clear instructions
after being alerted. This is done, in part, by the proper plan‐
ning and designation of ADSs.
D.3.6.2   Factors that influence the decision to measure or not
measure speech intelligibility include  those in D.3.6.2.1
through D.3.6.2.3.
Δ D.3.6.2.1   Possible reasons not to test speech intelligibility
include the following:
(1) Distance from the listener to loudspeaker is less than 30 ft
(9.1 m) in the room (assuming proper audibility and low
reverberation)
(2) Ambient sound level is less than 50 dBA and the average
SPL of the voice message is 10–15 dBA greater than the
ambient sound level
(3) No appreciable hard surfaces (e.g., glass, marble, tile,
metal)
(4) No appreciable high ceilings (i.e., ceiling height equals
loudspeaker spacing at a ratio of 1:1 optimal or 1:2 max)
Δ D.3.6.2.2   It might be acceptable to only spot test intelligibility.
One possible reason for spot sample testing is where the space
has been acoustically designed by individuals having skills suffi‐
cient to properly design a voice/alarm system for the occu‐
pancy to be protected (e.g., space has been designed using
commercially available computer modeling software acceptable
to the authority having jurisdiction).
Δ D.3.6.2.3   Possible reasons to test include the following:
(1) Appreciable hard surfaces (e.g., glass, marble, tile, metal)
(2) Appreciable high ceilings (e.g., atriums, multiple ceiling
heights)
D.3.6.3   In situations where there are several ADSs that have
the exact same physical and system configuration, it might be
possible to test only a representative sample and then just
check the others to confirm system and appliance operation —
for example, hotel rooms with similar layouts or offices of simi‐
lar size and furnishings where each has a loudspeaker appli‐
ance. In these cases there would be no expected difference in
system intelligibility. The only possible problem would be one
where an appliance was not operational or tapped at the incor‐
rect wattage. These problems would be apparent by a basic
“listening” test.
D.3.6.4   Not all ADSs will require speech intelligibility testing.
Some areas might be designed for notification, but not for
voice communication. Notification can be accomplished by
tone-only signaling or by a pre-alert tone preceding a voice
message. See D.3.5.5.
D.3.6.5   By definition, an ADS is relatively uniform in acoustic
characteristics. However, speech intelligibility will vary at differ‐
ent points within an ADS depending primarily on distance to
noise sources and distance to loudspeaker appliances. Gener‐
ally, in smaller spaces up to about 40 ft × 40 ft (12.2 m ×
12.2 m), one measurement location will be sufficient. The loca‐
tion should not be directly in front of a wall mounted loud‐
speaker or directly under a ceiling mounted loudspeaker.
Neither should it be in the far corner right next to walls or
windows. Generally, try to stay about 5 to 10 ft (1.5 to 3.0 m)
away from vertical surfaces that reflect sound. In larger spaces,
a grid of about 40 ft × 40 ft (12.2 m × 12.2 m) can be used as a
starting guide, then adjusted for the locations of machines and
other obstructions and for loudspeaker appliance locations.
See D.2.4 for additional discussion on measuring points and
the averaging of results in an ADS.
D.3.6.6   Of the ADSs that do require intelligible voice commu‐
nications, some will require speech intelligibility testing and
others might only require audibility testing.
D.3.6.7   Testing of intelligibility might not be required in
buildings and areas of buildings that are not acoustically chal‐

lenging and that meet the audibility requirements of NFPA 72.
Spaces that are not considered to be acoustically challenging
include traditional office environments, hotel guest rooms,
spaces with carpeting and furnishings that reduce reverbera‐
tion, and other, smaller spaces where a loudspeaker appliance
is installed in the space.
D.3.7 Measurement Points Within ADS.
D.3.7.1   Measurements should be taken at an elevation of 5 ft
(1.5 m) or at any other elevation deemed appropriate based on
occupancy (e.g., elevated walkways, child-height, sitting height,
work area height, etc.) or test instrument instructions.
D.3.7.2   The number and location of measurement points in
each ADS should be planned and based on the area and
volume of the space and the loudspeaker appliance location
within the space. The location of noise sources, egress paths,
and the locations of personnel in the space should also be
considered.
D.3.7.3   Testing when the area is occupied and when the ambi‐
ent sound level is at or near its expected maximum is preferred
because it is easier. However, it does involve playing of a test
signal through the emergency communications system for the
duration of the test. When testing using the STIPA signal, the
signal is a continuous noise signal. Other methods that meas‐
ure STI use a swept tone that should be repeated for each
measurement location. The alternate procedure is to test and
save the STI measurement data during unoccupied times,
measure and save the unoccupied sound level, and then take
and save sound level measurements during occupied times.
The three data sets are combined by software to calculate the
corrected STI for the area. Testing using this method requires
three measurements at each measurement location, but does
not subject occupants to constant test signals. The choice of
testing occupied versus unoccupied for intelligibility is the
same as for audibility testing of tone signaling systems and is
based on convenience versus disruption of normal use of the
space. However, unlike audibility testing, intelligibility testing is
less likely to contribute to the Cry Wolf Syndrome because the
test signal is not the same as the evacuation tone, which would
be sounded throughout testing of a tone signaling system. [Ref:
Schifiliti, Robert P., “Fire Alarm Testing Strategies Can Improve
Occupant Response and Reduce the “Cry Wolf” Syndrome,”
NEMA Supplement in Fire Protection Engineering, Society of
Fire Protection Engineers, Bethesda, MD 20814, Fall 2003.]
and [Ref: Brezntiz, S., “Cry Wolf: The Psychology of False
Alarms,” Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale, NJ, February
1984.]
D.3.7.4   If multiple measurement points are required within
an ADS, they should be separated by about 40 ft (12.2 m).
D.3.7.5   No more than one third of the measurement points
within an ADS should be on the axis of a loudspeaker.
D.3.7.6   See D.2.4 for the requirements for averaging the
results at different measurement points within an ADS.
D.3.7.7   Measurement points should be shown on plans or
otherwise described in a way that permits future testing at the
same locations.
D.3.8 Test Method — Occupied versus Unoccupied.
D.3.8.1   It is possible to conduct STI measurements when the
area is occupied or when it is not occupied. In this document
“occupied” versus “unoccupied” is intended to be consistent
with the definitions in D.2.3 for occupied ambient sound pres‐
sure level and for unoccupied ambient sound pressure level.
D.3.8.2   The preferred procedure is to conduct the STI/STIPA
test in the presence of the occupied ambient sound pressure
level. See D.6.4.
D.3.8.3   Where the test method is measuring the STI using the
STIPA test signal, the STIPA test signal can be played through
the system and the STI can be measured and the data saved by
the test instrument when the area is either not occupied or
when the background ambient conditions are not the occupied
ambient sound pressure level. It is also necessary to measure
and save the unoccupied ambient sound level at each measure‐
ment location. Then, during occupied times, take and save
ambient sound level measurements. The three data sets are
combined by software to calculate the corrected STI for the
area. See D.6.5.6.
D.4 Test Equipment Calibration for Testing Using STIPA Test
Signal.
D.4.1 General.
D.4.1.1   The calibration of the STI test instrument is done in
accordance with this section using a talkbox or in accordance
with manufacturer’s published instructions.
D.4.1.2   The Intelligibility Test System consists of a talkbox and
STIPA test meter (analyzer) all from one manufacturer. Units
from other manufacturers should not be interchanged unless
said units have been tested by a recognized testing laboratory
for compatibility (see D.2.3.5.2).
D.4.1.3   Prior to performing any intelligibility testing or intelli‐
gibility system calibration, verify that the test meter’s micro‐
phone, talkbox, and analyzer are within calibration date as
listed on the unit’s calibration tag.
D.4.1.4   All audio test equipment, including ANSI Type 2
sound pressure level meters required by NFPA 72 for audibility
testing, require regular calibration to known, traceable stand‐
ards. The portable meters used to measure STI using the STIPA
test signal should meet or exceed ANSI Type 2 meter require‐
ments. In addition, the STIPA test signal and the meter algo‐
rithm for measuring the received signal and calculating the
modulation transfer function to arrive at the STI should be
tested by a certifying laboratory for accuracy to the IEC stand‐
ard for STI.
D.4.2 Calibration Procedure.
D.4.2.1   The following procedures should be performed at the
commencement and conclusion of intelligibility testing. If the
following procedure differs from that recommended by the
manufacturer of the test equipment, follow their calibration
test procedure.
Δ D.4.2.2   Perform calibration procedures in a quiet room (45
dBA or less) without any extraneous sounds or any talking,
music, etc.
D.4.2.3   Start STIPA test tone as instructed by the manufac‐
turer.
D.4.2.4   Apply power to the talkbox and then actuate the
STIPA test signal.
D.4.2.5   Turn on the analyzer and set it to SPL A fast measure‐
ment mode.

2019 Edition Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material.
D.4.2.6   Place the analyzer’s microphone approximately 1 in.,
on axis, from the talkbox. Do not place the analyzer micro‐
phone against any hard surface — this can lead to induced
noise and affect the calibration.
D.4.2.7   Adjust the talkbox volume so that the STI analyzer’s
reading is approximately 92 dBA.
D.4.2.8   Keeping the analyzer in approximately the same posi‐
tion, measure the STI. Note that some meters display STI meas‐
urements using the CIS scale while some can display results in
either STI or CIS units. See D.2.4 for an explanation of the CIS
scale.
D.4.2.9   The equipment is working properly if the reading is
greater than 0.91 STI or 0.96 CIS. Up to three tests can be
performed. If the system does not pass after three tests, it
should be returned to the manufacturer for repair or recalibra‐
tion.
D.5 Talkbox Set-up.
D.5.1 Input Test Signal.
D.5.1.1   The input test signal should be configured to produce
the proper level by utilizing either the microphone input
method or the direct input injection method.
D.5.1.2   Most emergency communications systems have micro‐
phones for manual voice communication and should be tested
using the microphone test method. Systems that do not have
microphones and that only play prerecorded voice announce‐
ments can be tested using the direct input injection method.
D.5.1.3   By putting the STI or STIPA test signal into the system
via the system microphone, the ECS system is being tested from
end to end. If an ECS system has the test signal prerecorded in
its hardware, playback of that test signal would not be testing
the microphone and the part that feeds the microphone signal
into the system.
D.5.1.4 Direct Input Injection Method for Test Signals.
D.5.1.4.1   With this method the STI or STIPA test signals are
prerecorded in the emergency communications system hard‐
ware in the same way as the prerecorded voice messages and at
the same input levels. Alternately, the test signal can input to
the system via input jacks or terminals.
D.5.1.4.2   The input level of the test signal should be tested by
the ECS listing agency as being the same as the prerecorded
voice levels or should be calibrated using the ECS equipment
manufacturer’s published instructions.
D.5.1.4.3   For ECS systems that permit voice messages to be
custom recorded, the equivalent sound level (see A.18.4.4.1)Leq
of the recorded voice over a period of 10 seconds or the length
of the voice message should be measured and should be within
3 dB of the prerecorded STI or STIPA test signal to ensure that
it is at the correct level.
D.5.1.4.4   Field measurements of the STI are made using the
procedure in Section D.5.
D.5.1.5 Microphone Input Method for Test Signals.
D.5.1.5.1   With this method a recording of the STI or STIPA
test signals are played into the system microphone using a talk‐
box.
D.5.1.5.2   The talkbox is set up and calibrated per D.5.2, and
field measurements of the STI are made using the procedure
in Section D.6.
D.5.2 Calibrating the Input Test Signal for Microphone Input
Method.
D.5.2.1   Of the two methods for setting the test signal input to
the system microphone, the method that sets the level to match
that of a person speaking into the microphone is the one
required by IEC 60268-16, Sound system equipment — Part 16:
Objective rating of speech intelligibility by speech transmission index,
the standard that defines STI and STIPA.
D.5.2.2   In theory, the two methods for setting up the talkbox
should result in the talkbox being set at approximately the
same sound level. The ECS should be designed and configured
so that input to the microphone results in the same output
level that any prerecorded announcements would produce.
D.5.2.3 General.
D.5.2.3.1   There are two methods for setting the level of the
STI or STIPA test signal at the input microphone.
D.5.2.3.2   Method 1 sets the volume of the input test signal so
that the dBA output in the area under test is the same as that
for a prerecorded message.
D.5.2.3.3   Method 2 sets the volume of the input test signal to
match that of speech level under normal conditions.
D.5.2.3.4   The room where the talkbox and system under test
microphone are located should be quiet.
D.5.2.3.5   An emergency command center or fire command
center will not be free of noise during an actual emergency.
However, for testing purposes, the room should be relatively
free of extraneous noises that could affect the results. The
purpose of the tests is to establish the baseline capability of the
system and acoustic environment to support intelligible
communications. Good design practice for an emergency
command center is to isolate the space so that only emergency
command personnel have access. In addition, the location of
the microphone for manual input should be such that back‐
ground discussions and noise are minimized.
D.5.2.3.6   Set up the talkbox in accordance with the manufac‐
turer’s published instructions.
D.5.2.4 Method 1 — Matching Recorded Message Level.
D.5.2.4.1   The intent of this method is to set the talkbox or
audio source input level into the emergency communications
system microphone so that the output at a location in the area
under test is the same as the level of prerecorded messages
played by the system.
D.5.2.4.2   The sound pressure level produced by the talkbox
while playing the STI or STIPA test signal should be matched
with the sound pressure level of the prerecorded voice
message.
D.5.2.4.3   Two people will be needed to perform the calibra‐
tion procedure. One person needs to be present at the talkbox
while the other person needs to operate the analyzer at a typi‐
cal location in the facility.
D.5.2.4.4   At a typical location in the facility, position the
analyzer it so its microphone is approximately 5 ft (1.5 m)
above the finished floor.

D.5.2.4.5   Set the analyzer (meter) to measure sound pressure
level, A-weighted, fast.
D.5.2.4.6   Actuate the prerecorded voice message from the
ECS.
D.5.2.4.7   The decibel reading at the analyzer will be some‐
what erratic due to the nature of speech signals.
D.5.2.4.8   Record the highest dB reading the system produces.
D.5.2.4.9   Do not move the analyzer from the test location.
D.5.2.4.10   Turn off the prerecorded voice message.
D.5.2.4.11   Place the microphone of the emergency communi‐
cations system at a distance from the talkbox as recommended
by the microphone or ECS manufacturer.
D.5.2.4.12   Start the talkbox STI or STIPA test signal.
D.5.2.4.13   Adjust the talkbox sound level until the field meas‐
urement of the test signal is ±3 dB of the level generated when
the prerecorded voice message was played and measured. This
setting should not change for the remainder of the testing.
D.5.2.4.14   Begin field testing in accordance with Section D.6.
D.5.2.5 Method 2 — Matching Speech Level.
D.5.2.5.1   The intent of this method is to set the talkbox or
audio source input level to the emergency communications
system microphone to match that of an average person speak‐
ing into the microphone.
D.5.2.5.2   Set the analyzer (meter) to measure sound pressure
level, A-weighted, fast.
D.5.2.5.3   Start the STI or STIPA test signal and hold the
meter at a distance of 39.4 in. (1.0 m) on-axis from the talkbox
or audio source.
D.5.2.5.4   Set the talkbox volume (level) so that the meter
registers 65 dBA at a distance of 39.4 in. (1.0 m). This setting
should not change for the remainder of the testing.
D.5.2.5.5   The distance from the microphone to the talkbox
should be documented so that future tests can be set up consis‐
tently. Most microphone manufacturers or ECS equipment
manufacturers will state a recommended distance for a person
to hold the microphone when talking. Some microphone use
chin guards or some physical means to help users know when
they are holding the microphone at the correct distance. If the
manufacturer has not recommended a talking distance, 4 in.
(100 mm) is recommended as a guide.
D.5.2.5.6   Place the microphone of the emergency communi‐
cations system at a distance from the talkbox as recommended
by the microphone or ECS manufacturer.
D.5.2.5.7   A level of 60 dBA at one meter is required by IEC
60268-16, Sound system equipment — Part 16: Objective rating of
speech intelligibility by speech transmission index , the standard that
defines STI and STIPA and is considered a normal speech
level. While 60 dBA at 1 m is documented as “normal” speech,
in areas where there is background noise, the Lombard effect
causes a person to talk at an elevated volume. For this docu‐
ment, the committee chose to use 65 dBA as more representa‐
tive of speech levels during emergency situations. It is
recommended that at least one field STI measurement be
made at both 60 dBA and 70 dBA at one meter talking level to
test the effects of elevated voice level.
D.5.2.5.8   Sound pressure level increases 6 dB whenever the
distance is halved. So, the test could be set up so that the talk‐
box level achieves 65 + 6 = 71 dBA at a distance of 19.7 in.
(0.50 m). Table D.5.2.5.8 shows different dB levels at distances
that would be equivalent to 65 dBA at 39.4 in. (1.0 m).
D.5.2.5.9   Begin field testing in accordance with Section D.6.
D.6 STI/STIPA Test Procedure.
D.6.1 General.    This test procedure permits testing during
either occupied conditions or during unoccupied conditions.
See D.3.8.
D.6.2 Power.    The system under test should be tested on
secondary power for a minimum of 15 minutes and then on
primary power for the remainder of the testing.
D.6.3 System Operation.    Where two ADSs are adjacent to
each other and not separated by physically barriers that signifi‐
cantly prevent noise penetration from one ADS to another, the
notification appliances in both ADSs should be operating
during the testing. It is acceptable for intelligibility testing to
silence or disable other notification zones that would not
potentially interfere with each other. However, regular testing
per NFPA 72 would require that all circuits be operated simulta‐
neously at one point to ensure proper operation and to verify
power requirements.
D.6.4 Occupied Testing.
D.6.4.1   Testing should be done during a period of time when
the area is occupied and is reasonably close to having maxi‐
mum background noise.
D.6.4.2   Set up the talkbox in accordance with Section D.4 and
start the STI or STIPA test signal.
D.6.4.3   At each measurement point in each ADS measure the
STI.
D.6.4.4   Document the results on plans or forms in a way that
accurately describes the measurement point and that permits
future testing at the same locations.
D.6.5 Unoccupied Testing.
D.6.5.1 General.    Testing of speech intelligibility in the pres‐
ence of the occupied ambient sound pressure level is the
preferred method. However, for various reasons, including
disruption of normal work, it might be desirable to only do
“silent” testing during occupied periods and to do testing with

the STI or STIPA test signal during unoccupied or less occu‐
pied conditions.
D.6.5.2 Number of Tests.    This test method requires three
different measurements at each measurement point, typically
made during two site visits. The data for each measurement is
saved in a format in accordance with the instrument manufac‐
turer’s requirements. The three data files are then post-
processed to arrive at the final corrected STI.
D.6.5.3 Occupied Ambient Sound Pressure Level Measure‐
ment.
D.6.5.3.1   At each measurement point in each ADS measure
the occupied ambient sound pressure level.
D.6.5.3.2   Save the measurement data in accordance with the
instrument manufacturer’s requirements to permit post-
processing of the data.
Δ D.6.5.3.3   Document the results on plans or forms in a way
that accurately describes the measurement point and that
permits future testing at the same locations.
D.6.5.4 Unoccupied Ambient Sound Pressure Level Measure‐
ment.
D.6.5.4.1   At each measurement point in each ADS measure
the unoccupied ambient sound pressure level.
D.6.5.4.2   Save the measurement data in accordance with the
instrument manufacturer’s requirements to permit post-
processing of the data.
Δ D.6.5.4.3   Document the results on plans or forms in a way
that accurately describes the measurement point and that
permits future testing at the same locations.
D.6.5.5 Unoccupied STI Measurement.
D.6.5.5.1   Set up the talkbox in accordance with Section D.4
and start the STI or STIPA test signal.
D.6.5.5.2   At each measurement point in each ADS measure
the uncorrected STI.
D.6.5.5.3   Save the measurement data in accordance with the
instrument manufacturer’s requirements to permit post-
processing of the data.
Δ D.6.5.5.4   Document the results on plans or forms in a way
that accurately describes the measurement point and that
permits future testing at the same locations.
D.6.5.6 Post -Processing.
D.6.5.6.1   The corrected STI is arrived at by post-processing of
the occupied ambient sound pressure level measurement, the
unoccupied ambient sound pressure level measurement, and
the unoccupied STI measurement. In effect, the measured STI
(uncorrected) is being corrected by adding in the effects of the
actual expected (occupied) ambient sound pressure level.
D.6.5.6.2   The post-processing procedure or software provided
by the instrument manufacturer should be used to calculate
the final corrected STI for each measurement point.
Δ D.6.5.6.3   Document the results on plans or forms in a way
that accurately describes the measurement point and that
permits future testing at the same locations.
D.6.5.6.4   Documentation of the final results for each point
should include the results of all three measurements and the
final corrected STI value. The manufacturer’s software revision
should also be included in the results documentation.
D.7 Post Test Procedures.
D.7.1 Test Closure.    Upon completion of all testing, the emer‐
gency communications system should be returned to its normal
operating condition.
D.7.2 Results.
D.7.2.1   It is also not the intent of this test protocol to describe
how to interpret results or how to correct systems or environ‐
ments that contribute to poor speech intelligibility. However,
depending on the instrument used, it might be possible to have
data retained by the instrument to determine possible causes
and their effects on STI results. Consult with the instrument
manufacturer to determine if the instrument has the capability
to display or save the intermediate STI modulation indices and
octave band measurement results and for instructions on how
to interpret those data.
D.7.2.2   For each ADS, summarize the results in accordance
with the performance requirements of D.2.4.
D.7.2.3   For an ADS that had multiple measurement points or
that had multiple measurements at only one measurement
point, calculate the average per D.2.4 and list the average and
the minimum measurement per D.2.4 in the results summary.
D.7.3 Documentation.
D.7.3.1   The test results should be fully documented and provi‐
ded to the building owner, the emergency communications
system contractor, the system designer, the authority having
jurisdiction, and any other individual or organization deemed
appropriate.
Δ D.7.3.2   In addition to the requirements for test documenta‐
tion contained in NFPA 72, Chapter 10, the test results should
include:
(1) Building location and related descriptive facility infor‐
mation
(2) Names, titles, and contact information for individuals
involved in test
(3) Dates and times of tests
(4) A list of testing instruments, including manufacturer’s
name, model, serial number, and date of most recent
calibration
(5) Technical description of emergency communications
system
(6) Identification of ADSs
(7) Locations of specific measurement points (in a list or on
a set of drawings)
(8) Site definition of ambient sound pressure levels
(9) STI/STIPA measurements at each measurement point
(10) Final corrected STI/STIPA values where the post-
processing procedure is used
(11) Indication of whether or not the test met the pass/fail
criteria
(12) Record of system restoration
(13) Any additional information to assist with future evalua‐
tion of system performance
D.7.3.3   If appropriate, the plans and specifications addressed
in D.3.3 should be updated based on the results of the test.

Annex F   Wiring Diagrams and Guide for Testing Fire Alarm
Circuits
This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document
but is included for informational purposes only.
Annex F provides guidance for testing of the various classes of
circuits identified in Chapter 12 of this edition of NFPA 72. Earlier
editions of NFPA 72 have used different designations for these circuits.
Designations found in previous editions (located in Annex C of
NFPA 72, 2007 edition or earlier) can be compared with these corre‐
sponding diagrams.
Δ F.1 General.   Circuit class designations in this edition of the
Code are Class A, B, C, D, E, N, and X. Definitions can be
found in Chapter 12. Additionally, special circuits unique to
supervising stations are designated as Types 4, 5, 6, and 7 , and
definitions can be found in Chapter 26.
The wiring diagrams depicted in Figure F.2.1.1 through
Figure F.3.14(k) are representative of typical circuits encoun‐
tered in the field and are not intended to be all-inclusive.
The noted symbols are as indicated in NFPA 170.
An individual point-identifying ( i.e., addressable) fire alarm
initiating device operates on a signaling line circuit and is
designated as a Class A, Class B, or Class X initiating device
circuit. All fire alarm circuits must test free of grounds because
metallic conductors will cause failure of the circuit when a
second ground condition occurs on the same power source.
Nonmetallic circuit paths, such as wireless and fiber-optic,
might still be designated as Class A, B, or X if they meet the
other performance requirements of those pathways.
The following initiating device circuits are illustrative of
either alarm or supervisory signaling. Alarm-initiating devices
and supervisory initiating devices are not permitted to have
identical annunciation at the fire alarm control unit.

NATIONAL FIRE ALARM AND SIGNALING CODE72-368
2019 Edition Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material.
Directly connected system smoke detectors, commonly refer‐
red to as two-wire detectors, should be listed as being electri‐
cally and functionally compatible with the fire alarm control
unit and the specific subunit or module to which they are
connected. If the detectors and the units or modules are not
compatible, it is possible that, during an alarm condition, the
detector's visible indicator will illuminate, but no change of
state to the alarm condition will occur at the fire alarm control
unit. Incompatibility can also prevent proper system operation
at extremes of operating voltage, temperature, and other envi‐
ronmental conditions.
Where two or more two-wire detectors with integral relays
are connected to a single initiating device circuit, and their
relay contacts are used to control essential building functions
(e.g., fan shutdown, elevator recall), it should be clearly noted
that the circuit might be capable of supplying only enough
energy to support one detector/relay combination in an alarm
mode. If control of more than one building function is
required, each detector/relay combination used to control
separate functions should be connected to separate initiating
device circuits, or they should be connected to an initiating
device circuit that provides adequate power to allow all the
detectors connected to the circuit to be in the alarm mode
simultaneously. During acceptance and reacceptance testing,
this feature should always be tested and verified.
A loudspeaker is an alarm notification appliance, and, if
used as shown in the diagrams in Section F.2, the principle of
operation and supervision is the same as for other audible
alarm notification appliances (e.g., bells and horns).
The testing of supervised remote relays is to be conducted in
the same manner as for notification appliances.
F.2 Wiring Diagrams and Testing.    When testing circuits, the
correct wiring size, insulation type, and conductor fill should
be verified in accordance with the requirements of NFPA 70.
F.2.1 Testing Nonpowered, Hard-Wired Class A, B, or C Initiat‐
ing Device Circuits.   Disconnect conductor at device or control
unit, then reconnect. Temporarily connect a ground to either
leg of conductors, then remove ground. Both operations
should indicate audible and visual trouble with subsequent
restoration at control unit.
F.2.1.1 Hard-Wired Alarm Initiating or Supervisory Initiating
Devices.   Hard-wired alarm initiating devices (e.g., manual
station or valve supervisory switch), by their intended function,
initiate alarm upon a conductor-to-conductor short. See Figure
F.2.1.1.
F.2.2 Nonpowered Class A Circuits.    Disconnect a conductor
at a device at midpoint in the circuit. Operate a device on
either side of the device with the disconnected conductor.
Reset fire alarm control unit and reconnect conductor. Repeat
test with a ground applied to either conductor in place of the
disconnected conductor. Both operations should indicate audi‐
ble and visual trouble, then alarm or supervisory indication
with subsequent restoration.
F.2.3 Circuit-Powered (Two-Wire) Smoke Detectors for Class A
or B Initiating Device Circuits.    Remove smoke detector where
installed with plug-in base or disconnect conductor from fire
alarm control unit beyond first device. Actuate smoke detector
per manufacturer’s published instructions between fire alarm
control unit and circuit break. Restore detector or circuit, or
both. Fire alarm control unit should indicate trouble when
fault occurs and alarm when detectors are actuated between
the break and the fire alarm control unit. See Figure F.2.3.
F.2.4 Circuit-Powered (Two-Wire) Smoke Detectors for Class A
Initiating Device Circuits.    Disconnect conductor at a smoke
detector or remove where installed with a plug-in base at
midpoint in the circuit. Operate a device on either side of the
device with the fault. Reset control unit and reconnect conduc‐
tor or detector. Repeat test with a ground applied to either
conductor in place of the disconnected conductor or removed
device. Both operations should indicate audible and visual
trouble, then alarm indication with subsequent restoration. See
Figure F.2.4.
F.2.5 Combination Alarm Initiating Device and Notification
Appliance Circuits.   Disconnect a conductor either at indicat‐
ing or initiating device. Actuate initiating device between the
fault and the fire alarm control unit. Actuate additional smoke
detectors between the device first actuated and the fire alarm
control unit. Restore circuit, initiating devices, and fire alarm
control unit. Confirm that all notification appliances on the
circuit operate from the fire alarm control unit up to the fault
and that all smoke detectors tested and their associated ancil‐
lary functions, if any, operate. See Figure F.2.5.
F.2.6 Combination Alarm Initiating Device and Notification
Appliance Circuits Arranged for Operation with Single Open
or Ground Fault.   Testing of the circuit is similar to that descri‐
bed in F.2.5. Confirm that all notification appliances operate
on either side of fault. See Figure F.2.6.

F.2.7 Class A or B Circuits with Four-Wire Smoke Detectors
and End-of-Line Power Supervision Relay.    Testing of the
circuit is similar to that described in F.2.3 and F.2.4. Disconnect
a leg of the power supply circuit beyond the first device on the
circuit. Actuate initiating device between the fault and the fire
alarm control unit. Restore circuits, initiating devices, and fire
alarm control unit. Audible and visual trouble should indicate
at the fire alarm control unit where either the initiating or
power circuit is faulted. All initiating devices between the
circuit fault and the fire alarm control unit should actuate. In
addition, removal of a smoke detector from a plug-in-type base
can also break the power supply circuit. Where circuits contain
various powered and nonpowered devices on the same initiat‐
ing circuit, verify that the nonpowered devices beyond the
power circuit fault can still initiate an alarm. A return loop
should be brought back to the last powered device and the
power supervisory relay to incorporate into the end-of-line
device. See Figure F.2.7.
F.2.8 Class B Initiating Device Circuits with Four-Wire Smoke
Detectors That Include Integral Individual Supervision Relays.
Testing of the circuit is similar to that described in F.2.3 with
the addition of a power circuit. See Figure F.2.8.

F.2.12 System with Supervised Audible and Visual Notification
Appliance Circuits.    Testing of the notification appliances
connected to Class B is similar to that described in F.2.4. See
Figure F.2.12.
F.2.13 Series Notification Appliance Circuit That No Longer
Meets Requirements of NFPA 72.   An open fault in the circuit
wiring should cause a trouble condition. See Figure F.2.13.
F.2.14 Supervised Series Supervisory Initiating Circuit with
Sprinkler Supervisory Valve Switches Connected That No
Longer Meets Requirements of NFPA 72.   An open fault in the
circuit wiring or operation of the valve switch (or any supervi‐
sory signal device) should cause a trouble condition. The classi‐
fication of this circuit is now designated as Class D because the
intended operation is performed. When the circuit fails, the
indication at the fire control unit is the same as if the supervi‐
sory switch were to open. Fire alarm initiating devices, includ‐
ing supervisory inputs, are no longer allowed to annunciate as
trouble conditions. See Figure F.2.14.
F.2.15 Initiating Device Circuit with Parallel Waterflow Alarm
Switches and Series Supervisory Valve Switch That No Longer
Meets Requirements of NFPA 72.   An open fault in the circuit
wiring or operation of the valve switch should cause a trouble
signal. See Figure F.2.15.

tion until master box reset. See Figure F.2.16.
F.2.17 Auxiliary Circuit Connected to Municipal Fire Alarm
Master Box.    For operation with a master box, an open or
ground fault (where ground detection is provided) on the
circuit should result in a trouble condition at the fire alarm
control unit. A trouble signal at the fire alarm control unit
should persist until the master box is reset. For operation with
a shunt trip master box, an open fault in the auxiliary circuit
should cause an alarm on the municipal system. See Figure
F.2.17.
F.3 Circuit Classes.   Some testing laboratories and authorities
having jurisdiction permitted systems to be classified as Class X
by the application of two circuits operating in tandem. An
example of this is to take two series circuits, Class B, and oper‐
ate them in tandem. The logic was that if a condition occurs on
one of the circuits, the other series circuit remained operative.
To understand the principles of the circuit, alarm receipt
capability should be performed on a single circuit, and the
Class type, based on the performance, should be indicated on
the record of completion.

F.3.1 Style 0.5.    This signaling circuit operates as a series
circuit in performance. This is identical to the historical series
audible signaling circuits. Any type of break or ground in one
of the conductors, or the internal of the multiple interface
device, and the total circuit is rendered inoperative.
To test and verify this type of circuit, either a conductor
should be lifted or an earth ground should be placed on a
conductor or a terminal point where the signaling circuit
attaches to the multiplex interface device.
F.3.2 Style 0.5(a) (Class B) Series That No Longer Meets
Requirements of NFPA 72.   Style 0.5(a) functions so that, when
a box is operated, the supervisory contacts open, making the
succeeding devices nonoperative while the operating box sends
a coded signal. Any alarms occurring in any successive devices
will not be received at the receiving station during this period.
See Figure F.3.2.
F.3.3 Style 0.5(b) Shunt That No Longer Meets Requirements
of NFPA 72.   The contact closures when the device is operated
(and remains closed) to shunt out the remainder of the system
until the code is complete. See Figure F.3.3.
F.3.4 Style 0.5(c) Positive Supervised Successive That No
Longer Meets Requirements of NFPA 72.   An open or ground
fault on the circuit should cause a trouble condition at the
control unit. See Figure F.3.4.
F.3.5 Style 1.0 That No Longer Meets Requirements of
NFPA 72.   This is a series circuit identical to the diagram for
Style 0.5, except that the fire alarm system hardware has
enhanced performance. [See Figure F.3.5(a) and Figure F.3.5(b).]
A single earth ground can be placed on a conductor or multi‐
plex interface device, and the circuit and hardware will still
have alarm operability.
If a conductor break or an internal fault occurs in the path‐
way of the circuit conductors, the entire circuit becomes inop‐
erative.
To verify alarm receipt capability and the resulting trouble
signal, place an earth ground on one of the conductors or at
the point where the signaling circuit attaches to the multiplex
interface device. One of the transmitters or an initiating device
should then be placed into alarm.
F.3.6 Typical McCulloh Loop.    This is the central station
McCulloh redundant-type circuit and has alarm receipt capabil‐
ity on either side of a single break. See Figure F.3.6.
F.3.6.1   To test, lift one of the conductors and operate a trans‐
mitter or initiating device on each side of the break. This activ‐
ity should be repeated for each conductor.
F.3.6.2   Place an earth ground on a conductor and operate a
single transmitter or initiating device to verify alarm receipt
capability and trouble condition for each conductor.
F.3.6.3   Repeat the instructions of F.3.6.1 and F.3.6.2 at the
same time, verify alarm receipt capability, and verify that a trou‐
ble condition results.
F.3.7 Class B (Formerly Style 3.0).    This is a parallel circuit in
which multiplex interface devices transmit signal and operating
power over the same conductors. (See Figure F.3.7.)  The multi‐
plex interface devices might be operable up to the point of a
single break. Verify by lifting a conductor and causing an alarm
condition on one of the units between the central alarm unit
and the break. Either lift a conductor to verify the trouble
condition or place an earth ground on the conductors. Test for
all the valuations shown on the signaling table.
On ground-fault testing, verify alarm receipt capability by
actuating a multiplex interface initiating device or a transmit‐
ter.
F.3.8 Style 3.5 That No Longer Meets Requirements of
NFPA 72 .   Follow the instructions for Class B (formerly Style
3.0) and verify the trouble conditions by either lifting a
conductor or placing a ground on the conductor. See Figure
F.3.8.

NOTE: Some manufacturers of this type of equipment have
isolators as part of the base assembly. Therefore, in the field,
this component might not be readily observable without the
assistance of the manufacturer’s representative.

ANNEX G 72-375
Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material. 2019 Edition
Annex G   Guidelines for Emergency Communication
Strategies for Buildings and Campuses
This annex is not part of the requirements of this NFPA document but
is included for informational purposes only.
G.1   The material in this annex is based on the National Insti‐
tute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Fire Protection
Research Foundation research Guidance Document: Emergency
Communication Strategies for Buildings, by Erica Kuligowski, Ph.D.
and H. Omori, 2014, as adapted by the NFPA ECS TC.
The purpose of this annex is to provide guidance to system
designers, building managers, and/or building emergency
personnel responsible for emergency communication on how
to create and disseminate messages using basic communication
modes (audible and/or visual technology). The guidance
provided here is taken directly from a report published by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology, which was
based on a review of 162 literature sources from a variety of
social science and engineering disciplines (Kuligowski et al.
2012) and the prioritization of the specific findings extracted
from each literature source.
This document first presents guidance on how to create and
disseminate emergency information in the face of rapid-onset
disasters1 — providing guidance on the dissemination of alert
signals, the creation of the warning message, the formatting of
messages for both visual and audible means, and the dissemina‐
tion of the warning message. This document then provides
examples of emergency messages (i.e., message templates) for
five different types of emergency scenarios. These message
templates can be altered to fit the needs of your occupants, as
well as the type of emergency that has occurred and type of
technology used to disseminate the alerts/messages.
G.2 Guidance on Emergency Communication Strategies.    This
section provides guidance for managers, emergency personnel,
alarm system manufacturers, codes/standards committees, or
others responsible for emergency communication on the ways
in which alerts and warning messages should be created,
formatted, and disseminated. The guidance is divided into two
main parts: guidance on alerts and guidance on warning
messages. Although these two parts often get confused, it is
important to distinguish between the purpose of an alert and a
warning message.
An alert is meant to grab peoples’ attention, notifying them that
an emergency is taking place and that there is important infor‐
mation, which will be provided to them. The purpose of a warn‐
ing message is to give that important information to occupants.
Guidance on the construction and dissemination of both alerts
and warnings is provided here.
G.2.1 Alerts.    It is imperative to disseminate an alert to let
occupants know that a warning message will follow. Regardless
of whether the warning message is provided audibly, visually, or
via tactile means, an alert is necessary to gain people’s attention
and should be provided separately from the warning message.
An effective alert should include the following characteristics:
(1) Alerts should be significantly different from ambient
sounds.
(2) Buildings should reduce background noise when initiat‐
ing audible alerts.
(3) Flashing, rather than static lights, preferably one standard
color for all buildings, can be used to gain attention to
visual warning messages.
(4) There are additional methods to alert occupants to an
emergency: disruption of routine activities, tactile meth‐
ods, social networks, and face-to-face.
(5) An alert signal should be accompanied by a clear, consis‐
tent, concise, and candid warning message.
(6) If selected, an alert should be tested for its success in
getting occupants’ attention in the event of an emergency
and used as part of building- or campus-wide training.
G.2.2 Warnings.    Warning messages should provide informa‐
tion to the occupants on the state of the emergency and what
they are supposed to do in response to this emergency. The
warning message should come after an alert signal is given and
can be provided via visual or audible means. However, before
such guidance on message format for visual and audible
messages can be provided, it is vital to provide guidance on the
content of the warning message itself.
G.2.2.1 The Message.    Regardless of the method used to
disseminate the warning message, there are certain characteris‐
tics that are required of an effective warning message. These
are included here:
(1) Message Content.
(a) A warning message should contain five important
topics to ensure that occupants have sufficient
information to respond.
i. Who is providing the message? (i.e., the
source of the message)
ii. What should people do? (i.e., what actions
occupants should take in response to the
emergency and, if necessary, how to take
these actions)
iii. When do people need to act? (In rapid-onset
events, the “when” is likely to be “immedi‐
ately.”)
iv. Where is the emergency taking place? (i.e.,
who needs to act and who does not)
v. Why do people need to act? (including a
description of the hazard and its dangers/
consequences)
(b) The source of the message should be someone
who is perceived as credible by the occupants
(c) Building managers, campus managers, and emer‐
gency personnel should understand the affected
population and, from this understanding, develop
a database of possible trusted sources (as well as
backup sources).
(2) Message Structure.
(a) Message order for short messages (e.g., 90 -charac‐
ters) should be the following:
i. Source
ii. Guidance on what people should do
iii. Hazard (why)
iv. Location (where)
v. Time.
(b) Message order for longer messages should be the
following:
i. Source
ii. Hazard
iii. Location
iv. Guidance
v. Time

2019 Edition Shaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions. N = New material.
(c) Numbered lists can help to chronologically organ‐
ize multiple steps in a process
(d) For limited message length, message writers could
draft the message in a bulleted form; each of the
five topics in the warning should be separated as its
own bullet point
(e) Distinct audiences should be addressed separately
in the message (or in multiple messages)
(3) Message Language (or Wording).
(a) Messages should be written using short, simple
words, omitting unnecessary words or phrases.
(b) Messages should be written using active voice,
present tense, avoiding hidden verbs.
(c) Messages should be written using short, simple,
and clear sentences, avoiding double negatives and
exceptions to exceptions; main ideas should be
placed before exceptions and conditions.
(d) Emergency messages should be written at a sixth
grade reading level or lower. An emergency
message can be evaluated for its reading level using
computer software and/or a simple calculation.
(e) Emergency messages should be written without the
use of jargon and false cognates.
(f) Emergency messages should be provided in the
language of the predominant affected populace. If
there is a possibility of isolated groups that do not
speak the predominant language, multilingual
messages should be provided. It is expected that
small groups of transients unfamiliar with the
predominant language will be picked up in the
traffic flow in the event of an emergency and are
not likely to be in an isolated situation.
(4) Multiple Messages.
(a) Building managers, campus managers, and emer‐
gency personnel should anticipate the need to
write more than one emergency message through‐
out a disaster, including feedback messages or
updates.
(b) In update messages, occupants should be told why
the information has changed, to ensure that the
new message is viewed as credible.
(c) Provide feedback messages after a “non-event” to
inform occupants that the alert signal and warning
system operated and worked as planned and the
reasons why the event did not occur.
(d) Building managers, campus managers, and emer‐
gency personnel should test emergency messages
with the affected population.
(5) Visual Warnings.
(a) Messages that are displayed visually will have differ‐
ent capabilities and limitations than those dissemi‐
nated audibly. Message creators should consider
different factors and make different types of deci‐
sions based upon the dissemination method. The
first consideration is the type of visual technology
that will be used to disseminate the messages,
which can include textual visual displays, SMS text
messages, computer pop-ups, email, Internet
websites, news (TV broadcast), or streaming broad‐
cast over the web. Depending upon the technology
chosen to display visual warning messages, guid‐
ance is provided here on message displays to
enable occupants to see or notice the displayed
warning, understand the warning, perceive warn‐
ing credibility and risk, and respond appropriately.
(6) Noticing and Reading the Warning.
(a) Place the emergency sign in a location where
people will notice it and be able to read it from
their original (pre-emergency) location.
(b) Signs will be reliably conspicuous within
15 degrees of the direct line of sight.
(c) Text is easier to read when written with a mixture
of upper and lower case letters rather than the use
of all capitals.
(d) The recommended relationship for older adults
with lower visual acuity is D = 100 * h, providing a
more conservative result, and ensuring that a
larger population will be able to read the emer‐
gency message.
(e) A stroke-to-width ratio of the letters is suggested as
1:5 (generally), with a ratio of 1:7 suggested for
lighter letters on a darker background.
(f) Building managers, campus managers, or emer‐
gency personnel should consult the ADA Stand‐
ards for Accessible Design (U.S. Department of
Justice 2010) for additional requirements on
signage.
(g) Contrast between the text and the background
should be at least 30 percent, although recommen‐
ded values could be as high as 60 percent.
(h) The use of pictorials (in lieu of or in addition to
text) can also bring attention to the sign.
(i) Message providers should ensure that emergency
information is not blocked by other signs or infor‐
mation.
(7) Comprehending, Believing, and Personalizing the Warn‐
ing.
(a) Printed text should accompany symbols or pictori‐
als used in visual warnings; a minimum number of
words should be used to accompany graphics.
(b) Diagrams that display a series of sequential steps
are more successful for comprehension of a proc‐
ess than one single graphic.
(c) A color-contrasted word or statement should be
used for text that should be read first and/or be
perceived as more urgent than the rest, unless
color is used for other reasons (e.g. bilingual text).
(d) A warning message can increase in perceived credi‐
bility and risk if occupants are shown that others
are also responding.
(e) Simultaneously displayed text (discrete messages)
is preferred rather than a sequentially displayed
message.
(f) Simultaneously displayed text can also be used for
bilingual messages, especially if care is taken to
differentiate the text of one language from the text
of the other language.
(g) Limit the use of flashing words on visual message
displays.
(8) Audible Warnings.
(a) There are specific warning technologies that only
(or primarily) affect the aural sense, including
public address systems (voice notification systems),
automated voice dialing, satellite/AM/FM radio
broadcasts, satellite/off-air television broadcasts,
and tone alert radios. Whereas visual technologies

can limit message length, audible warnings are
often limited only by the attention capabilities of
the audience. In other words, an audible message
can play for long periods of time with these tech‐
nology types, and the message creator and source
must be careful to provide all important informa‐
tion in an appropriate length of time.
(b) In this section, guidance will be given for methods
to increase the likelihood that an individual will
perceive, or hear, the message. Following this,
guidance will be provided that can increase
comprehension of the message for audible
messages, as well as the ways in which to increase
credibility and risk assessment of the event when
the warning is presented audibly.
(9) Perception.
(a) Other, non-alert/warning voices in the back‐
ground should be reduced or eliminated.
(b) Any voice announcements should also be accompa‐
nied by simultaneous visual text.
(10) Comprehending, Believing, and Personalizing the Warn‐
ing.
(a) Letters are more difficult to identify in speech than
numbers, which are more difficult than colors.
(b) People making announcements (or other message
sources) should not be heavily accented and
should speak with a rate of approximately 175
words per minute.
(c) Audible warnings can be delivered using a live
voice, dynamic voice (generated by text-to-speech
software), or using prerecorded voice.
(d) The live voice and dynamic voice methods provide
the benefit of messages that can be updated with
new information while also conveying an appropri‐
ate level of urgency, if necessary.
(e) Dynamic and prerecorded voice methods provide
the benefits of easily repeating the played messages
for longer periods of time and not relying on the
voice announcer training or stress level while deliv‐
ering the message.
(f) For the voice itself, best results will vary, depending
on the specific location — for example, in outdoor
applications, it has been shown that a male voice
will provide better intelligibility, as the naturally
lower frequency of the male voice travels better.
Inversely, in an interior application, where the
background ambient noise is typically in the same
lower frequencies, a female voice tends to pene‐
trate better, as it is more distinct from the ambient.
(g) Urgency measures should be used selectively to
emphasize the more dangerous, immediate, life-
threatening situations (since overuse can lead to
non-response in future disasters).
(11) Dissemination of the Warning Message.
(a) Use multiple channels to disseminate the warning
message, including visual, audible, and tactile
means.
(b) A warning message should be repeated at least
once, with some research advocating for message
repetition of at least three times.
(c) Messages should be stated in full, and then repea‐
ted in full, rather than repeating statements within
the same message.
(d) Warning messages should be repeated at intervals,
rather than consecutively.
(e) Warning messages should be disseminated as early
as possible.
(f) Face-to-face communication should accompany
other audible or visual technologies.
(g) Messages should be disseminated using a combina‐
tion of both push and pull technologies.
(h) Push communication2 is most important to use for
alert signals as well as initial warning messages.
G.3 Emergency Message Templates.   Rapid-onset emergencies
often come with little warning and can have a major impact on
communities. In order to provide clear, effective instructions
for a threatened population, it is important to create message
templates ahead of time for a variety of different emergencies.
This section provides examples of message templates for five
types of emergency, using various forms of emergency commu‐
nication technology. All bracketed text can be altered and
replaced with text that better suits the needs of the occupants,
emergency scenario, emergency response strategies, and the
technology being used. Please see Kuligowski and Omori
(2014) for more information on the process associated with the
development of these templates. Each template follows the
guidance presented in this document.
G.3.1 Scenario 1 — Fire in a building, partial evacuation strat‐
egy, building-wide public address announcements.    Scenario 1
is a fire located on the 10th floor of a 20-story building. Individ‐
uals are unable to use elevators in this scenario, except for
those who are unable to negotiate the stairs, in which case
building staff or fire fighters will assist them using the freight
elevator(s).
Protective actions: Occupants on floors 9, 10, and 11 are told
to evacuate to the 8th floor (two floors below the fire floor). All
other occupants are provided with a message to remain on
their floor. Therefore, in this scenario, two different types of
messages are required to be provided simultaneously to occu‐
pants, depending upon the floor on which they are located:
one message will be disseminated to floors 9, 10, and 11, while
a different message will be disseminated simultaneously to all
other floors.
Technology used to disseminate the message:  The building-wide
public address system, which is capable of providing different
messages to different floors (using a live voice or a dynamic
voice).
G.3.1.1 Message Templates for Scenario 1:
(1) Building-wide announcement to Floors 9, 10, and 11:
“Attention [floors 9, 10, and 11]. This is your [Building
Safety Officer, Joe Smith]. A fire has been reported on
the [10th floor] of the building. Everyone on the [9th,
10th, and 11th floors] should move to the [8th floor] to
be protected from heat and smoke, since heat and smoke
can creep into nearby floors during a fire. Use the stairs
immediately. Do not use the elevators. Those who need
help getting to the 8th floor, please wait inside the stair‐
well [or go to the freight elevator lobby].”
(2) Building-wide announcement to all other floors: “Atten‐
tion. This is your [Building Safety Officer, Joe Smith]. A
fire has been reported on the [10th floor] of the build‐
ing. Please wait on your floor. At this time, you are safer
remaining on your floor than leaving the building,
because this building is designed to confine the fire [e.g.,

locally or to the 10th floor only]. Do not use the elevators
for any reason. We will give you further instructions, if the
situation changes.”
G.3.2 Scenario 2 — Fire in a building, full evacuation strategy,
building-wide public address announcement, and cell phone
text message.   Scenario 2 is a fire located on the second floor
of a 20-story building in which smoke is traveling up the buil‐
ding’s air-conditioning/venting system, causing the need for a
full-building evacuation. Individuals are unable to use elevators
in this scenario, except for those who are unable to negotiate
the stairs, in which case building staff or fire fighters will assist
them using the freight elevator(s).
Protective actions:  Occupants on all floors are requested to
evacuate the building, known as a full-building evacuation.
Technologies used to disseminate the message:  The building-wide
public address system, which is capable of providing different
messages to different floors (using a live voice or a dynamic
voice). Also, a 90-character text message alert to cell phone
users in the building.
G.3.2.1 Message Templates for Scenario 2:
(1) Building-wide public address system: “Attention. This is
[Chief Smith from the Springfield Fire Department]. A
fire has been reported on the [second floor] of the build‐
ing. Everyone must leave the building now to avoid
contact with the fire’s heat and smoke. Go NOW to your
closest stair and leave the building. People who cannot
use the stairs should go to the freight elevator lobby for
help.”
(2) Cell phone text message (90 characters): “Evacuate build‐
ing now. It is on fire. Go to freight elevator if you need
help.”
Note: A description of the hazard (a more detailed “why” statement)
is not included in this message due to character limits. Also, the source
is not listed. It is possible that the source will already be identified in the
“From” or “FRM” line of the text message. If message contents are limi‐
ted, there is always the option to send a follow-up text message that
provides more information or that continues the previous message. Also
remember that some phones (i.e. non-smart phones) could display longer
text messages in reverse chronological order.
G.3.3 Scenario 3 — Tornado imminent on a college campus,
campus-wide audible messaging system, and Twitter message.
Scenario 3 is a tornado imminent on a college campus.
Protective actions: The individuals on the college campus are
instructed to “shelter in place.” Additionally, the National
Weather Service provides examples of protective actions (inclu‐
ded below):
Example 1: “TAKE COVER NOW. FOR YOUR PROTEC‐
TION MOVE TO AN INTERIOR ROOM ON THE LOWEST
FLOOR OF A STURDY BUILDING.”
Example 2: “TAKE COVER NOW. MOVE TO AN INTERIOR
ROOM ON THE LOWEST FLOOR OF A STURDY BUILDING.
AVOID WINDOWS. IF IN A MOBILE HOME...A VEHICLE OR
OUTDOORS...MOVE TO THE CLOSEST SUBSTANTIAL
SHELTER AND PROTECT YOURSELF FROM FLYING
DEBRIS.”
Example 3: “THE SAFEST PLACE TO BE DURING A
TORNADO IS IN A BASEMENT. GET UNDER A WORK‐
BENCH OR OTHER PIECE OF STURDY FURNITURE. IF NO
BASEMENT IS AVAILABLE...SEEK SHELTER ON THE
LOWEST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING IN AN INTERIOR
HALLWAY OR ROOM SUCH AS A CLOSET. USE BLANKETS
OR PILLOWS TO COVER YOUR BODY AND ALWAYS STAY
AWAY FROM WINDOWS.”
IF IN MOBILE HOMES OR VEHICLES... .EVACUATE
THEM AND GET INSIDE A SUBSTANTIAL SHELTER. IF NO
SHELTER IS AVAILABLE...LIE FLAT IN THE NEAREST
DITCH OR OTHER LOW SPOT AND COVER YOUR HEAD
WITH YOUR HANDS.”
(Examples found here: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/view/valid‐
Prods.php?prod=TOR)
Technologies used to disseminate the message:  A campus-wide
siren system with audible messaging capabilities. Also, a
140-character Twitter3 message should be disseminated as well
for this emergency.
G.3.3.1 Message Templates for Scenario 3:
(1) Campus-wide audible messaging system): Alert tone precedes
message [siren]. “This is [Joan Smith, Chief of Campus
Police]. A tornado has been sighted on the ground at
[20th Street and Mockingbird Lane]. The tornado is
strong and is moving toward the college campus at high
speeds (with winds over 160 mph). High winds and large,
flying debris can flatten a building in a storm of this
magnitude. Take shelter now. Get inside now, go to the
lowest level, and get away from windows. Stay there until
further instructions.”
(2) Twitter message (140 characters): “Take shelter inside a
building NOW. Go to the lowest level, get away from
windows. Strong tornado near campus.” [Include hashtag
in 140 characters.]
Note: The source of the message is not included in this Twitter
message since the source will be evident from the Twitter message layout.
G.3.4 Scenario 4 — Chemical spill in a building, building-wide
public address announcements, and building-wide email
messages.   Scenario 4 is a chemical spill in a 40-story office
building. The event was an accident and occurred on the 1st
floor of the building. There is the possibility of the chemical
negatively affecting individuals on the lower floors of the build‐
ing. Individuals are unable to use elevators in this scenario. For
those who are unable to negotiate the stairs, only one freight
elevator will be used with fire-fighter assistance.
Protective actions: Occupants are advised to perform different
actions based upon the floor on which they are located. First,
occupants on the first floor are advised to evacuate the build‐
ing. At the same time, occupants on floors 2 through 10 are
advised to travel to locations higher in the building — prefera‐
bly to floors 20 through 30. Concurrently, occupants on floors
11 and above are advised to remain in place. Therefore, in this
scenario, three different types of messages are required to be
provided simultaneously to occupants, depending upon the
floor on which they are located: one message will be dissemina‐
ted to the first floor, one message will be disseminated to floors
2 through 10, and a third message will be disseminated to all
other floors.
Technologies used to disseminate the message: The building public
address system, which is capable of providing different message
to different floors (using a live voice or a dynamic voice). Addi‐
tionally, an email message (through the company’s email

system) should be disseminated to employees on floors 2
through 10 to relocate to a higher floor. [ Note: Do not worry
about an email to other employees, although in an actual emergency,
that would be necessary.]
G.3.4.1
(1) Building-wide public address system: [first floor occu‐
pants] “This is your [Building Manager, Joe Smith]. A
dangerous chemical has spilled on the first floor. The
chemical makes it difficult to see and can cause trouble
breathing. Evacuate immediately.”
(2) Building-wide public address system: [floors 2 through
10] “This is your [Building Manager, Joe Smith]. A
dangerous chemical has spilled on the first floor. The
chemical makes it difficult to see and can cause trouble
breathing. Immediately use the stairs to relocate to the
[20th through 30th floors], and then wait for further
instructions. If you can’t use the stairs on your own, go to
the freight elevator and wait for help. Relocate now.”
(3) Building-wide public address system: [floors 11 and
above] “This is your [Building Manager, Joe Smith]. A
dangerous chemical has spilled on the first floor. The
chemical makes it difficult to see and can cause trouble
breathing. People on [floors 1 through 10] are being
evacuated. Please stay on your floor. You are safer remain‐
ing where you are than if you try to leave the building.
The chemical will not reach people on floors 11 and
above. You would possibly be exposed to the chemical if
you tried to leave the building. Do not use the elevators
for any reason. We will give you further instructions if the
situation changes.”
Note: Provide emails with the same messages as listed above.
G.3.5 Scenario 5 — Violent event in an airport, airport-wide
visual messaging screens, and cell phone text message.    The
fifth scenario is a violent event. Specially, the emergency
involves an active shooter that has been identified in a major
U.S. airport.
Example protective action:  Occupants should evacuate the
airport through all accessible doors, including doors from the
gate waiting areas onto the tarmac area.
Technologies used to disseminate the message (along with example
character limits that can be typical for these types of technologies):  A
90-character text message alert to individuals’ phones within
the airport. Also, airport-wide visual messaging screens (limit
message to 60 words or less) can be used to alert individuals in
terminals where the shooter is NOT located.
G.3.5.1 Message Templates for Scenario 5:
(1) Airport-wide visual messaging screens: “This is Los
Angeles Police. Evacuate the terminal NOW. Follow direc‐
tions from airport security. Shots have been fired near
Gate 22.”
(2) Cell phone text message (90 characters): “Leave NOW.
Follow airport security. Shots fired! Police report: Shooter
in Terminal A.”
Note: A description of the hazard (a more detailed “why” statement)
is not included in this message due to character limits. If message
contents are limited, there is always the option to send a follow-up text
message that provides more information or that continues the previous
message. Also remember that some phones (i.e., non-smart phones)
could display longer text messages in reverse chronological order.
G.4 Future Direction.    The purpose of this report is to provide
guidance to system designers, building managers, and building
emergency personnel responsible for emergency communica‐
tion on how to create and disseminate effective messages using
basic communication modes (audible vs. visual technology), as
well as examples of emergency messages (message templates)
for five different types of emergency scenarios. START (2013)
contains additional message templates for similar types of
rapid-onset events for both limited- and unlimited-character
length dissemination technologies. Additionally, Kuligowski
and Omori (2014) provide guidance on how to test the effec‐
tiveness of these messages.
As with any document, there are gaps in the research that
hinder the ability to provide guidance on certain topics, includ‐
ing message length and repetition. This guidance document
focuses specifically on textual message creation, creating room
for additional guidance on the development and testing of
visual symbols that could be used instead of, or in addition to,
textual emergency messages. In the future, as research gaps are
addressed, additional editions of this document would be
useful to enhance the findings and guidance provided here.

G.6 Footnotes.    1 Rapid-onset emergencies are those emergen‐
cies that occur with no or almost no (in the case of minutes)
notice, rather than slow-onset events (i.e., emergencies in
which the occurrence is known hours or even days in advance).
These different emergency types require different sets of emer‐
gency messages and dissemination techniques to allow building
occupants to receive information in a timely manner, resulting
in efficient and safer public response.
2 Push technologies are those that do not require individuals
to take extra effort to receive the alert or warning message
(e.g., public address systems or text messages), whereas pull
technologies require the individual to seek additional informa‐
tion to acquire the alert/message (e.g., Internet websites).

fied are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

N Annex H   Carbon Monoxide
This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document
but is included for informational purposes only.
N H.1 Dangers of Carbon Monoxide.    Carbon monoxide is an
odorless, tasteless, colorless gas produced by incomplete
combustion. Solid, liquid, or gaseous fuels can each, under
certain conditions, produce lethal concentrations in the home.
(See Table H.1 and Figure H.1.)
The values in Table H.1 are approximate values for healthy
adults. Children, the elderly, and persons with preexisting phys‐
ical conditions might be more susceptible to the effects of
carbon monoxide exposure. Continued exposure after uncon‐
sciousness can cause death. The dangers of carbon monoxide
exposure depend on a number of variables, such as the occu‐
pant’s health, activity level, time of exposure, and initial
carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) level. Due to these variables,
Table H.1 and Figure H.1 are to be used as general guidelines
and might not appear quantitatively consistent.
The following equation for determining the estimated
percent of COHb in the blood is from “A proposal for evaluat‐
ing human exposure to carbon monoxide contamination in
military vehicles,” by Steinberg and Nielson and “Considera‐
tions for the physiological variables that determine the blood
carboxyhemoglobin concentration in man” by Coburn, Forster,
and Kane.

N H.2 Information for Emergency Responders.    Guideline
Summary. How public emergency response organizations
respond to carbon monoxide (CO) incident calls is essential
for the safety of the building occupants and the emergency
responders. One reference that can be helpful to emergency
responders is the Consumer Product Safety Commission
(CPSC) Responding to Residential Carbon Monoxide Incidents:
Guidelines for Fire and Other Emergency First Response Personnel .
This guide is designed to help emergency responders act
quickly and effectively when responding to a CO incident, and
it provides the following:
(1) Guidelines for dispatchers handling calls
(2) Incident reporting forms to help emergency responders
identify the elevated source of carbon monoxide, the
level of care needed by occupants, and when it is safe for
occupants to return to the building
(3) Advice and actions to give building occupants

page
Step 2 – Comment Stage
• Public Comments accepted on First Draft (10 weeks) fol-
lowing posting of First Draft Report
• If Standard does not receive Public Comments and the 
Technical Committee chooses not to hold a Second Draft 
meeting, the Standard becomes a Consent Standard and 
is sent directly to the Standards Council for issuance (see 
Step 4) or
• Technical Committee holds Second Draft Meeting

• Correlating Committee ballots on Second Draft  
(8 weeks)
• Second Draft Report posted on the document informa-
tion page
Step 3 – NFPA Technical Meeting
• Notice of Intent to Make a Motion (NITMAM) accepted 
(5 weeks) following the posting of Second Draft Report
• NITMAMs are reviewed and valid motions are certified 
by the Motions Committee for presentation at the NFPA 
Technical Meeting
• NFPA membership meets each June at the NFPA Techni-
cal Meeting to act on Standards with “Certified Amend-
ing Motions” (certified NITMAMs)
• Committee(s) vote on any successful amendments to the 
Technical Committee Reports made by the NFPA mem-
bership at the NFPA Technical Meeting
Step 4 – Council Appeals and Issuance of Standard
• Notification of intent to file an appeal to the Standards 
Council on Technical Meeting action must be filed within 
20 days of the NFPA Technical Meeting
• Standards Council decides, based on all evidence, 
whether to issue the standard or to take other action
Notes:
1. Time periods are approximate; refer to published sched-
ules for actual dates.
2. Annual revision cycle documents with certified amend-
ing motions take approximately 101 weeks to complete.
3. Fall revision cycle documents receiving certified amend-
ing motions take approximately 141 weeks to complete.
Committee Membership 
Classifications1,2,3,4

keter of a product, assembly, or system, or portion 
thereof, that is affected by the standard.
2. U User: A representative of an entity that is subject to 
the provisions of the standard or that voluntarily 
uses the standard.
3. IM Installer/Maintainer: A representative of an entity that 
is in the business of installing or maintaining a prod-
uct, assembly, or system affected by the standard.
4. L Labor: A labor representative or employee concerned 
with safety in the workplace.
5. RT Applied Research/Testing Laboratory: A representative 
of an independent testing laboratory or indepen-
dent applied research organization that promulgates 
and/or enforces standards.

standard or portion thereof.
NOTE 1: “Standard” connotes code, standard, recom-
mended practice, or guide.
NOTE 2: A representative includes an employee.
NOTE 3: While these classifications will be used by the 
Standards Council to achieve a balance for Technical Com-
mittees, the Standards Council may determine that new 
classifications of member or unique interests need repre-
sentation in order to foster the best possible Committee 
deliberations on any project. In this connection, the Stan-
dards Council may make such appointments as it deems 
appropriate in the public interest, such as the classification 
of “Utilities” in the National Electrical Code Committee.
NOTE 4: Representatives of subsidiaries of any group are 
generally considered to have the same classification as the 
parent organization.

Information on the NFPA Standards Development Process
I. Applicable Regulations. The primary rules governing the processing of NFPA standards (codes, standards, 
recommended practices, and guides) are the NFPA Regulations Governing the Development of NFPA Standards (Regs). Other 
applicable rules include NFPA Bylaws, NFPA Technical Meeting Convention Rules, NFPA Guide for the Conduct of Participants in 
the NFPA Standards Development Process, and the NFPA Regulations Governing Petitions to the Board of Directors from Decisions of 
the Standards Council. Most of these rules and regulations are contained in the NFPA Standards Directory. For copies of the 
Directory, contact Codes and Standards Administration at NFPA Headquarters; all these documents are also available on 
the NFPA website at “www.nfpa.org.” 
The following is general information on the NFPA process. All participants, however, should refer to the actual rules and 
regulations for a full understanding of this process and for the criteria that govern participation. 
II. Technical Committee Report. The Technical Committee Report is defined as “the Report of the responsible 
Committee(s), in accordance with the Regulations, in preparation of a new or revised NFPA Standard.” The Technical 
Committee Report is in two parts and consists of the First Draft Report and the Second Draft Report. (See Regs at  
Section 1.4.)
III. Step 1: First Draft Report. The First Draft Report is defined as “Part one of the Technical Committee Report, which 
documents the Input Stage.” The First Draft Report consists of the First Draft, Public Input, Committee Input, Committee 
and Correlating Committee Statements, Correlating Notes, and Ballot Statements. (See Regs at 4.2.5.2 and Section 4.3.) 
Any objection to an action in the First Draft Report must be raised through the filing of an appropriate Comment for 
consideration in the Second Draft Report or the objection will be considered resolved. [See Regs at 4.3.1(b).]
IV. Step 2: Second Draft Report. The Second Draft Report is defined as “Part two of the Technical Committee Report, 
which documents the Comment Stage.” The Second Draft Report consists of the Second Draft, Public Comments with 
corresponding Committee Actions and Committee Statements, Correlating Notes and their respective Committee 
Statements, Committee Comments, Correlating Revisions, and Ballot Statements. (See Regs at 4.2.5.2 and Section 4.4.) 
The First Draft Report and the Second Draft Report together constitute the Technical Committee Report. Any outstanding 
objection following the Second Draft Report must be raised through an appropriate Amending Motion at  
the NFPA Technical Meeting or the objection will be considered resolved. [See Regs at 4.4.1(b).]
V. Step 3a: Action at NFPA Technical Meeting. Following the publication of the Second Draft Report, there is a period 
during which those wishing to make proper Amending Motions on the Technical Committee Reports must signal their 
intention by submitting a Notice of Intent to Make a Motion (NITMAM). (See Regs at 4.5.2.) Standards that receive 
notice of proper Amending Motions (Certified Amending Motions) will be presented for action at the annual June NFPA 
Technical Meeting. At the meeting, the NFPA membership can consider and act on these Certified Amending Motions as 
well as Follow-up Amending Motions, that is, motions that become necessary as a result of a previous successful Amending 
Motion. (See 4.5.3.2 through 4.5.3.6 and Table 1, Columns 1-3 of Regs for a summary of the available Amending Motions 
and who may make them.) Any outstanding objection following action at an NFPA Technical Meeting (and any further 
Technical Committee consideration following successful Amending Motions, see Regs at 4.5.3.7 through 4.6.5.3) must be 
raised through an appeal to the Standards Council or it will be considered to be resolved. 
VI. Step 3b: Documents Forwarded Directly to the Council. Where no NITMAM is received and certified in accordance 
with the Technical Meeting Convention Rules, the standard is forwarded directly to the Standards Council for action on 
issuance. Objections are deemed to be resolved for these documents. (See Regs at 4.5.2.5.)
VII. Step 4a: Council Appeals. Anyone can appeal to the Standards Council concerning procedural or substantive matters 
related to the development, content, or issuance of any document of the NFPA or on matters within the purview of the 
authority of the Council, as established by the Bylaws and as determined by the Board of Directors. Such appeals must be in 
written form and filed with the Secretary of the Standards Council (see Regs at Section 1.6). Time constraints for filing an 
appeal must be in accordance with 1.6.2 of the Regs. Objections are deemed to be resolved if not pursued at this level. 
VIII. Step 4b: Document Issuance. The Standards Council is the issuer of all documents (see Article 8 of Bylaws). The 
Council acts on the issuance of a document presented for action at an NFPA Technical Meeting within 75 days from the 
date of the recommendation from the NFPA Technical Meeting, unless this period is extended by the Council (see Regs at 
4.7.2). For documents forwarded directly to the Standards Council, the Council acts on the issuance of the document at its 
next scheduled meeting, or at such other meeting as the Council may determine (see Regs at 4.5.2.5 and 4.7.4). 
IX. Petitions to the Board of Directors. The Standards Council has been delegated the responsibility for the 
administration of the codes and standards development process and the issuance of documents. However, where 
extraordinary circumstances requiring the intervention of the Board of Directors exist, the Board of Directors may take 
any action necessary to fulfill its obligations to preserve the integrity of the codes and standards development process 
and to protect the interests of the NFPA. The rules for petitioning the Board of Directors can be found in the Regulations 
Governing Petitions to the Board of Directors from Decisions of the Standards Council and in Section 1.7 of the Regs. 
X. For More Information. The program for the NFPA Technical Meeting (as well as the NFPA website as information 
becomes available) should be consulted for the date on which each report scheduled for consideration at the meeting will 
be presented. To view the First Draft Report and Second Draft Report as well as information on NFPA rules and for up-to-
date information on schedules and deadlines for processing NFPA documents, check the NFPA website (www.nfpa.org/
docinfo) or contact NFPA Codes & Standards Administration at (617) 984-7246.
